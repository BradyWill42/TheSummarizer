Hey there! Looks like 2023 was a BIG year for you! The main story here is the surge in income—wages jumped by a MASSIVE $203K compared to 2022. Plus, you did really well with taxable interest and dividends, which saw a healthy increase of $2.7K. And those gains? A nice lift of $1.6K! It's great to see such positive growth, especially with the stock market being so up and down.

Alongside your income boost, your total adjusted gross income went up significantly, leading to a higher taxable income as well—more than $205K over last year. Even though your deductions remained pretty stable, you added a new qualified business income deduction, which is awesome! This reflects your growing business venture. Keep an eye on those standard deductions, as the slight increase there shows some room for strategic planning.

On the tax payments side, you had to pay more withholdings and taxes due to your increased income. But remember, it’s actually good to pay more because it means you made more money!

You've still managed to secure some credits, though they stayed on par with last year, while your deductions saw a slight increase, helping manage your overall tax liability.

Hello Gregory and Emma! It looks like you've had an interesting financial year in 2023 with some notable changes. Your wages decreased significantly by $883,308 compared to 2022, while your interest income increased by $13,199. It's important to consider how these shifts impact your overall financial landscape.

In terms of your adjusted gross income, there was a drop from $2,058,621 in 2022 to $1,152,419 in 2023. This was largely due to the reduction in business income and other income losses totaling a combined $138,749. However, you did manage to maintain consistent medical deductions, which likely provided some relief against your taxable income.

Despite the income changes, the total tax paid decreased considerably from $699,541 to $342,079 in 2023, which also reflects the changes in your adjusted gross income. Your overpayment dropped to $421, which highlights the importance of reviewing your withholding to better align with these income variances.

Looking ahead, I recommend assessing your investment strategies and ensuring deductions are fully utilized where applicable. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to explore strategies for the upcoming year!
