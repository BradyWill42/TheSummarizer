In 2023, there was a substantial increase in wages, salaries, and tips, rising by approximately $202,980 compared to 2022, which significantly boosted total income by $207,285.

Hey there! Looks like 2023 was a BIG year for you! The main story here is the surge in income—wages jumped by a MASSIVE $203K compared to 2022. Plus, you did really well with taxable interest and dividends, which saw a healthy increase of $2.7K. And those gains? A nice lift of $1.6K! It's great to see such positive growth, especially with the stock market being so up and down.

Alongside your income boost, your total adjusted gross income went up significantly, leading to a higher taxable income as well—more than $205K over last year. Even though your deductions remained pretty stable, you added a new qualified business income deduction, which is awesome! This reflects your growing business venture. Keep an eye on those standard deductions, as the slight increase there shows some room for strategic planning.

On the tax payments side, you had to pay more withholdings and taxes due to your increased income. But remember, it’s actually good to pay more because it means you made more money! Your effective tax rate rose a bit too, but nothing too alarming given your significant income rise. If you have any questions or want to discuss adjusting estimates for next year, just let me know. Cheers to another great year ahead!

In 2023, there’s been a big jump in income compared to 2022. Wages and salaries went up significantly, as did taxable interest and dividend income.

However, 2023 saw a little bump with the qualified business income deduction inching up by one. Nothing too wild, but every bit helps.

Taxes and payments also saw some lively action this year. Taxable income soared, which naturally led to a boost in the total tax due. But look at those payments!

Now, let's chat about taxes. With the increase in income, your taxable income almost doubled too. Of course, this means your taxes went up, but that's a good thing of course—indicating all the gains you've made this year! You've still managed to secure some credits, though they stayed on par with last year, while your deductions saw a slight increase, helping manage your overall tax liability.
