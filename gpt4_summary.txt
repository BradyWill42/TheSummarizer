Hope all is well! You've had a fantastic year, with your total income jumping by 207k compared to last year. Notably, you've seen a significant increase in wages and salaries, with an impressive rise of 203k This is a great sign of your hard work paying off!

The increased income has understandably led to a higher tax liability of 94k up by 56k from 2022. This is primarily because your taxable income rose significantly, reflecting your successful financial year. However, you've managed this well, with a bump in withholdings covering a big chunk of it, leaving you with a manageable balance due.

Looking ahead, you might consider adjusting your withholdings to better match your expected income for next year. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need guidance on planning for the upcoming tax year. Congrats once again on your progress!

This significant increase in income is primarily due to a substantial rise in wages, salaries, and tips.


The increase in your income resulted in a higher tax liability.  Your total tax increased from 38k in 2022 to 94k in 2023. However,  this is still a very positive outcome, showing significant growth in your earnings. Your tax payments also increased significantly, from 38k in 2022 to 84k in 2023, and your effective tax rate went up from 18.70% to 22.27%. Let's discuss adjusting your withholdings next year to avoid a large payment at tax time.


Your itemized deductions in 2023 (28k) exceeded the standard deduction, so we used those.  This includes medical deductions, state and local taxes, interest, and contributions, all of which saw increases compared to 2022. We will always use whichever method will maximize your refund, and that means analyzing your tax returns and deductions very carefully year over year.  We filed this exactly how it should be reported.


In 2023, you had a tax refund of 2k which is much lower compared to the refund in 2022. This is simply a result of the increase in your income and total tax liability; it still reflects a strong financial year. We maximized all deductions and credits available to minimize your tax liability.


Overall, your 2023 tax return reflects a year of strong financial growth. The higher tax liability is a direct result of this success, but your overall financial picture is incredibly positive.

Hey there!  Another great year for you! Your 2023 tax return shows a BIG refund of 2k a significant increase compared to the 106.0 refund you received in 2022.

This jump in income is fantastic, and while it means a higher tax bill overall, the increased refund is a great outcome.

Your taxable income also saw a substantial increase, rising from 235k in 2022 to 440k in 2023. This growth reflects the positive developments in your financial situation.  Your tax liability naturally increased, from 38k in 2022 to 94k in 2023.  Despite this increase, the higher refund demonstrates the effectiveness of your tax planning.  Considering the significant bump in income, the overall tax picture is still very positive.

Looking at the details, we see your wages, salaries, tips, etc. increased substantially from 259k in 2022 to 462k in 2023.  Other income sources also contributed to this growth, resulting in a much higher overall income.  Your total tax payments during 2023, including withholdings and estimated payments, totaled 84k  resulting in the significant 2k refund.

Importantly, your itemized deductions in 2023 (28k) exceed the standard deduction, so we've itemized deductions in the calculation. Your medical deductions, state and local taxes, interest, and contributions were all included in this calculation.


Overall, this was a financially successful year, and your tax situation reflects that positive performance.  Let me know if you have any questions about this summary, or if you'd like to discuss adjusting your withholdings for next year to potentially receive more frequent smaller refunds!
