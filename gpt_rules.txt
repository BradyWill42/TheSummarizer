Analysis of Structure, Tone, and Form of Provided Document
1. Structural Patterns:
Opening Context: Each summary begins with a personalized statement or acknowledgment of the client's tax situation. This could reference specific gains, losses, or changes in income.
Key Details: The middle portion elaborates on major financial events, changes in tax positions, and any new elements such as stock gains, deductions, or refunds.
Actionable Points: The conclusion often includes advice, recommendations, or assurance of accuracy, such as suggestions for future quarterly payments or noting any corrective measures taken (e.g., adjusting cost basis).
Consistency Across Years: For repeat clients, prior years’ financial and tax contexts are compared to emphasize changes or trends.
2. Tone of Voice:
Conversational and Reassuring: The tone is warm, engaging, and non-technical, even when discussing complex tax topics. Examples include phrases like “good to have gains,” “a great year for you,” or “not too much considering your overall income.”
Client-Centric: Each section is tailored to the client's unique financial context, with references to specific events or circumstances (e.g., “Congrats on the new job at Alnylam!”).
Balanced Positivity: Even potentially negative outcomes (e.g., owing taxes) are reframed positively (e.g., “good to pay taxes on stock trades—it means you made money!”).
Action-Oriented: Summaries often end with a request for questions or a statement of preparedness to handle future adjustments.
3. Form and Formatting:
Paragraph-Length Summaries: Each summary is concise, typically 1–3 short paragraphs, with key points condensed into accessible and skimmable text.
Colloquial Phrases: Common idiomatic language (e.g., “hope all is well,” “a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!”) makes the summaries feel personal.
Caps for Emphasis: Select words or phrases (e.g., “MASSIVE gain,” “BIG refund”) are occasionally capitalized to emphasize critical points.
Instructions for AI to Recreate Tone, Structure, and Form:
Start with Personalized Context:
Open with a warm, conversational acknowledgment of the client’s overall financial performance (e.g., “Another great year for you!”).
Highlight key differences compared to the previous year, such as income changes or major tax events.
Use a Positive and Reassuring Tone:
Frame outcomes (even negative ones) in a positive light. For example, reframe tax liabilities as indicative of gains or success.
Avoid jargon, using simple and approachable language for complex tax topics.
Structure Around Key Financial Events:
Identify and summarize major tax-related events (e.g., wage increases, capital gains, deductions).
Highlight how these events impact the client's tax liability or refund.
Mention any new actions taken (e.g., reporting cost basis adjustments, filing additional forms).
Maintain a Friendly, Human Voice:
Use colloquial phrases and casual punctuation (e.g., exclamation marks, contractions).
Emphasize rapport with personal touches like “Let me know if you have any questions” or “Hope all is well.”
Conclude with Actionable Steps or Next-Year Suggestions:
Recommend future actions, such as adjusting withholdings.
Provide a clear closing statement inviting the client to follow up with questions.
Highlight Specific Changes Using Emphasis:
Use capitalization sparingly for key words (e.g., “MASSIVE gain”).
Break out significant changes or new events in their own sentence for clarity.
If comparing columns, only compare last two years.
