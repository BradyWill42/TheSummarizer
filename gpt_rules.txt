OWED
Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $35k and your withholdings kept up.  The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that Ann {I have attached} had some social security disability income with no withholdings.  Finally a new thing this year is we are filing a Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for Michael to make sure he is in compliance with that reporting requirement.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.
You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on your Yumanity shares {I have attached} (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  Your alimony is a big deduction which we continue to take and helps reduce the amount you owe.  Jane's business income was down slightly year over year but still bringing in good money.  We got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to XXX's switching jobs back. {I have attached} Finally, made sure to note that Jane made an extra $7k contribution to her IRA.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!
You would have owed about $12k to federal and very little to MA without the HUGE long term capital gains on the trades (good to have gains, and they were taxed at the most favorable rate).  Still having that much in gains is the reason why you owe how much you owe.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.
You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE buyout in your job (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  That is offset by a BIG refund in NY though!  Everything else 
questions - thanks! 
OWED DUE TO STOCK VESTING
You owe a good amount this year because you had $420k of options income and $80k of restricted stock income vesting to your W2.  This was withheld at the standard 22% rate whereas you are squarely in the 32-35% tax bracket so this was underwithheld by a good amount.  Nothing you can do about it - just letting you know why you owe.  Everything else looks good - let me know if any questions - thanks!
OWED DUE TO ISO STOCK EXERCISE
You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE $108k gain on your Relay shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  You additionally had another $26k added to your tax bill due to AMT tax on the "bargain element" income of $131k you have to recognize for AMT tax purposes on the ISO options you exercised and held.  We will file to preserve this amount as an AMT tax credit which we will be able to utilize when AMT taxable income is lower than regular tax income (which should hopefully happen when you sell these shares).  We are tracking the AMT cost basis of these shares so if you eventually sell them we can adjust the cost basis and realize the aforementioned tax credit.  Finally, with respect to the AMT, we itemized instead of taking the higher standard deduction because it lowered your AMT income and thus lowered your overall taxes.  Additionally, we made sure to note your $6k contribution to your IRA.  All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!
OWED DUE TO SALE OF RENTAL
You owed a good amount due to a BIG gain ($312k) on the sale of your rental (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  The reason you have such a big gain is because of depreciation recapture - you get a tax break up front on your rental but they track the depreciation and now tax you on it.  That said, we also tracked your suspended losses on the rental and used that to offset your gain (that was a $54k offset).  All that being said you did a GREAT job with the estimated payment and only owe a little bit.
You owe a bit due to a decent gain on the sale of your rental (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  The reason you have a gain is because of depreciation recapture - you get a tax break up front on your rental but they track the depreciation and now tax you on it.  That said, we also tracked your suspended losses on the rental and used that to offset your gain.  We set up your return so that you are partial residents in both CA and MA and taxed accordingly.  As discussed, please adjust the state withholdings on your military pension as it is taxable in CA.  Finally, we got you the excess social security withheld due to both of you switching jobs.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are enjoying CA - let me know if any questions - thanks!
REFUND
BIG refund this year as you got $2,000 child tax credit as well as dependent care credit as well as making sure the amounts contributed to your dependent care account weren't taxed.  We got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to XXX's switching jobs back.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!
BIG refund this year again as you got most of your quarterly payments back due to Tonia shutting down her business halfway through the year.  We took all possible tax deductions on Tonia's business return, including the home office deduction.  I obviously did not set you up with quarterly payments for next year as Tonia has shut down her business.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest but the refinance led to it being lower this year by about $5k.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well and congrats again on Maggie- let me know if any questions - thanks!
BIG refund this year as you finally got to file jointly!  The benefit of having Andrew's lower income combined with Emily's higher income means much more of Emily's income is taxed in lower tax brackets, which gives you a big benefit.  This benefit overwhelms any potential benefit from filing separately and claiming a higher child tax credit on Andrew's return if filed separately.  As previously discussed, we will follow up in May to see how your withholdings are progressing but this is a great basis to start with!  Please reach out in May at your convenience.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!
Vertex quarterlies plus dependent care plus mortgage limitation explanation
BIG refund this year again as you got most of your quarterly payments back due to your wages being down a good bit (due to less stock compensation flowing through your W2 for options exercises).  We reported the 2 new K1s as well as all your trades, which showed a slight long term gain after all the capital gain distributions .  You did great with the dependent care account in maxxing out the Vertex match and we made sure it wasn't taxed.   I obviously brought down your automatic quarterly payments for next year to $15k per quarter to reflect the current situation.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest but the refinance led to it being lower this year due to the $750k mortgage cap (the previous mortgage with Citzens was eligible for $1MM mortgage balance as it was originated just before the new tax code rules were passed for mortgages).  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!
Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news (probably due to lower value of stock compensation vesting). That said, it means you have a GREAT refund this year - finally! Based on last year I reduced your automatic quarterlies to $10k per quarter. Everything else looks good preserving the loss on the rental for future years to offset future hopeful rental gains. Let me know if any questions - thanks.
Big increase in wages combined with decrease in mortgage interest paid (a good thing) led to your refund going down a bit but still it is a good refund.  We got you the excess social security withheld of $2,719 due to Kamna's switching jobs as well as $1,600 child care credit as well as $2,000 child tax credit.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!
Slight refund
Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news but it means you are back to a slight refund this year! Everything else looks good continuing to write off $3,000 in trading losses against regular income and preserving the rest for future years to offset future hopeful trading gains. Let me know if any questions - thanks!
Slight losses in your trades last year when adjusted for proper cost basis so that you aren't double taxed.  This isn't necessarily the best news but it means you are getting a refund this year. Everything else looks good we wrote off the trading losses of $2,233 against regular income and are deducting your mortgage interest and charity. Let me know if any questions - thanks!
Zero income so get a refund due to a weird reason
The bad news is you had significant losses on your trades last year.  The good news is it COMPLETELY wiped out your big gain on the Vertex sale as well as gave you a credit on health insurance premiums paid so you have a refund.  Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks.
Everything the same
Everything remained almost exactly the same as the previous year except you have less mortgage interest (a good thing) which means you take the standard deduction now instead of itemize as the standard deduction is higher than your state and real estate tax paid (capped at $10,000) and mortgage interest combined.  You did great with the dependent care account in maxxing it out and we made sure it wasn't taxed.  Let me know if any questions - thanks! {I have attached}

Your wage income went up a lot - almost $25k! You also made some money on your trades and the sale of your Taylor Swift - tickets - good for you!  We made sure to zero out the money received from Venmo as that was a payment for expenses you made and not income.  In addition you are now itemizing which helped you out as well on your tax return.  We made sure to split the mortgage between you and your partner.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Client 5

2021
Nice rental - it's really cashflowing nicely! You make so much from it that you still have taxable income after depreciation - that's rare to happen in the first year. It's also the reason why you owe in RI. You owe significant amounts to fed and MA due to sizable capital gains (but still all long term so best tax treatment possible). Great stuff!

2022

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT no stock sales led to a big reduction in capital gains and thus you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income and a lot less than last year. Your wages went up $16k and your withholdings kept up. The rental property is still cashflowing really nicely leading to you owing a little bit to RI. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023
Nice increase in your rental income of $7k and another $7k increase in interest and dividends has you owing a bit as compared to last year but it's for good reasons!  Again the rental is also the reason why you owe in RI. Glad to see you are still doing the ESPP hopefully that works out for you in the long term.  Hope you are well and as always - please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

Hope you've been enjoying the cottage in Maine! Your return swung from a slight refund to owing slightly due to you having gains on your stock trades. But that's ok - good to pay taxes on stock trades - it means you made money! Let me know if any questions thanks.

p.s. Very similar to 2 years ago as no big capital gains this year (as opposed to last year). Please let me know if any questions - thanks and stay warm!

p.s.  This year you made much more in dividends and interest than 2022 and thus owe a bit more to fed and MA (about $2,750 for Fed and $500 for MA). Thus we have set you up on automatic quarterlies, per your request, of $3,450 for federal and $550 for MA.  Everything else looked good - please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Nice refund this year as you got the full $10,000 SALT (state and local tax) deduction after we hunted down your taxes paid.  That combined with your mortgage interest and charity was a nice deduction and swung you from owing to a refund!  You also got a $600 energy tax credit.  Finally made sure to report all your ISO transactions and as we predicted you weren't subject to AMT which is great.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2021

Your wages were up last year by a good amount and your withholdings didn't keep up and thus the amount you owe went up a decent bit compared to 2020. It would have been $3,000 smaller but you got paid the child tax credit in advance. We got you almost $3k back for your dependent care expenses. Finally, we made sure to note your respective $6k IRA contributions. Everything else looked similar to last year. We suggest $1,500 quarterlies based on this year - let me know if you want me to set it up to be paid automatically from the bank account I have for you as I can do that with my software. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022
p.s. Your wages were up about $91k last year - thus you owe a bit more due to Nigel's many jobs (when you work multiple jobs typically the withholdings start at a lower level at first). The new thing that helped you out was Nigel had a business this year - luckily there were many expenses for that income and thus we were able to write a business loss off against your other income. We also got you the excess social security withheld of $2.746 due to Nigel's many jobs back. Finally some nice interest and dividends good stuff. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went down a little bit - you owe a good amount considering your overall income.  Your wages went down $36k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased distribution from Allianz Life which had minimal tax withholdings.  In addition you had good investment income of about $12k.  Also Nigel had a loss on his business (a good thing come tax time) but it was $6k less than last year and thus less of a deduction for you.  Therefore I recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $7,500 federal but y ou chose to hold off for this year.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Rental property is really cashflowing nicely! Let me know if any questions - hope all is well with you and yours....

2022
p.s. Your wage income went up a lot - almost $100k! A good portion of that was restricted stock vesting but about $35k of the increase was due to Renee's new job. This job had very little withholdings on it - only $1k - and is the primary reason why you owe so much more than last year. Additionally you had increased income from your trades and your rental property (cashflowing really well - nice rent raise!). Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Again your wage income went up a lot - almost doubled to increase by $392k! $515k of those wages was restricted stock vesting but about $48k of the increase was due to Renee's new job. This job had very little withholdings on it - only $463 - and the combination of the two is the primary reason why you owe so much more than last year. Additionally you had big gains (almost $40k) from your trades which were all long term capital gains to be taxed at the best rate possible. In MA you are getting $4k back from the septic job and you'll get an additional $1k back next year - nice! Finally your rental property continues to cashflow really well. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Congrats to both of you on getting married - I'm 14 years in and it's the best thing I ever did - wishing the same for you!  As for your return, you owe a good amount even with your quarterlies due to a BIG gain on your Vertex shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  $50,000 of the gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate while $10k is taxed as short term capital gains.  We made sure to FULLY deduct your mortgage interest (it was still limited by the $750k mortgage balance limitation, but still it's a great deduction for you).  Finally, we provided you quarterlies for the upcoming year based on last year's experience but also provided you an analysis showing you save $16.5k in taxes by filing jointly!  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Great year for you - the business was up again last year, you did a great job with the quarterlies, and the birth of Ollie - congrats! He gave you an extra $5,000 in your refund - $3,600 for child tax credit and $1,400 for the stimulus payment. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022
p.s. Good size refund again this year as you got $2,000 child tax credit as well as had great quarterly payments to take care of what was owed due to Jackie's business income. Jackie's business income was down a bit (about $12k) but still made about $7k. I am providing quarterlies again for you Jackie so please keep up with the quarterly payments. Finally, made sure to deduct your IRA contribution. We also excluded the gain on the sale of your place in Dorchester. Finally, next year we should be able to itemize and get you a higher tax deduction with a full year of mortgage interest. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well and enjoying the new house - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Big jump in Jackie's business income combined with good quarterly payments led to yet another good size refund again this year.  You got $2,000 child tax credit as well (and next year it will be $4,000 - congrats again!).  I am providing quarterlies again for you Jackie so please keep up with the quarterly payments. Finally, made sure to deduct your IRA contribution and student loan interest. Finally, as predicted we were able to itemize this year and get you a higher tax deduction with a full year of mortgage interest. All in all, another great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Holy income Batman! Great year your income was up almost $500k from last year. Unfortunately the quarterlies were based on last year's income so you owe a lot more to both federal and MA but it's right. The max SEP contribution is in there.

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your partnership income went up $55k and your quarterly payments kept up so you ended up with a good refund.  The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that gain on the sale of the UWill shares - good news was it was all long term capital gains though.  We continue to itemize to take advantage of your mortgage interest and charity.  We also made sure to max out your SEP IRA at $66k and take a health insurance deduction of $14k as well. 

Additionally we prepared tax returns for Jared and Justin and have sent them to you as well.

Finally we have recommended quarterlies of $40k and $8k to federal and MA respectively based on last year.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. You owe a bit due to a BIG gain in your business income from $7k to $21k (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  Your wages went up $13k and your withholdings kept up.   I created quarterlies for you to use if you think you'll have the same level of income in your business - they will be sent in a separate link. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your federal withholdings went down a good amount - about $3.5k - any idea why?  It doesn't really make sense as your wages were basically the same as last year..  Right now our system is saying you owe $170 in underpayment penalties (aka interest).  Your business income went up $7k - nice!  We took all possible tax deductions against this income.  I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $1,500 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Your withholdings went down significantly last year and that's why you owe slightly but that's good - you had your money working for you!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year IRA income by 60k  - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Jonathan did a great job factoring in the $12k solar credit you got - make sure you up your withholdings for next year!  Finally your rental lost a bit more (about $6k more) due to extra expenses. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Big jump in your IRA income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $15k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that Cindy had some social security income with no withholdings - not a big deal as the increase wasn't that much (about $600) - just making you aware. Finally your rental lost a little more (about $1k more) due to extra expenses and reduced rent. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Very similar to last year. Decent increase in capital gain distributions from Wells Fargo (up to $37k) which led to owing in MA. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022
p.s. You owe a good amount due to a big increase in your wages due to restricted stock vesting (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). You made two quarterlies of $25k each and if you paid all four you would have been spot on - therefore I set you up with $25k quarterlies for this year assuming a similar situation (but please adjust as you see fit). You have a $14k capital gain - $13k of the gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. Finally, made sure to note that both of you made an extra $7k contribution to your IRAs. Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

p.s. You owe a good amount due to a big increase in your wages due to a big increase in Vertex stock price making your restricted stock vesting much more valuable (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). You are now subject to the MA Millionaire's Tax and owed an extra $25k there because of it.  

You made three quarterlies of $25k each and if you paid all four you would have been very close to break even but a little short - therefore I set you up with $30k quarterlies for this year assuming a similar situation (but please adjust as you see fit). You have a $19k capital gain - all of it is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. Finally, made sure to note that both of you made an extra $7.5k contribution to your IRAs. Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

You made a LOT of money and unfortunately owe a lot in taxes. In Delaware you owe because the withholdings on the W2 came out at 5.1% of wages but it should be around 6.5% (DE top tax rate of 6.6%) - not sure why they didn't do that. Please book a zoom with me so we can talk about federal taxes and state too and discuss everything - thanks.

BIG refund this year again as you got your quarterly payments back.  We took the standard deduction as it was higher than itemizing.  I obviously did not set you up with quarterly payments for next year as you are getting such big refunds it's probably not necessary unless you get a big bonus.  Finally, you got a $2k child tax credit for Charlotte - nice.  Let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise with the exception that your capital gains went down a LOT (about $180k)- you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $35k and your withholdings for that income kept up.  We got you the excess social security withheld of $111 due to you having 2 jobs back.  Your rental property stayed cashflowing very well at the same rate as last year. Everything else looked good and you owe about $34k less than last year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a similar amount to last year even though your income was UP almost 200k!  Paying quarterlies kept what you owed in the same ballpark AND helped you avoid paying tax penalties this year.  Your capital gains went up a LOT (about $88k) and it was all taxed as long term capital gains at the most favorable rate.  Your rental property stayed cashflowing very well and the increase in rent had you making $6k more than last year.  Finally recommended checking out the ESPP at Biogen and talking to me about it if you'd like to.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Wow what a swing from owing a lot to a HUGE refund! Having multiple jobs gave you a lot of excess social security withholdings that you got back with this filing (about $8k). That in addition to itemizing your mortgage interest and possibly higher withholdings on your new jobs got you a great refund congrats!

p.s. Big increase from last year income wise but your refund still went up! Your wages went up $94k and your withholdings more than kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that because your income was above $400k you lost the $2,000 per child tax credit (but you did get $3,600 for your 3 children). You also got $1,200 back in dependent care expneses. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Nice refund yet again! Your wages went up $82k and your withholdings more than kept up. We talked about adjusting withholdings to reduce your refund but agreed it's for the best to keep them where they are right now.  You also got $1,200 back in dependent care expenses. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Slight decrease in your wages last year (probably due to lower value of Vertex stock meaning lower valuation of restricted stock vesting) and Slight gains in your Vertex trades last year but I made sure to adjust for proper cost basis so that you aren't double taxed.  Everything else looks good finally getting a REFUND! Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. You owe a little bit to the feds due to a pretty big gain in your wages (about $43k) and gains from trades on your Vertex shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain on the trades is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. You owe in Oregon due to this increase as well and you didn't get the "kicker" you got last year from Oregon (that's a surplus refund - last year you got $3,665 from it) so Oregon return is more like two years ago when you owed about $2k. Everything else looks good - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Slight increase in your wages last year with good withholdings combines with $850 energy efficiency tax credit leads to a slight refund federally - nice!  You are getting a MASSIVE refund in MA thanks to a $10,291 "KICKER" return of surplus revenues from Oregon.  Oregon has honestly got to be the weirdest tax state ever - took a while to figure this out.  Anyways I'm glad to be able to get you such a good result!  Everything else looks good and normal. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

Nice year income wise for you! Set up quarterly payments as we discussed - pleasure working with you!

2022

p.s. Nice refund this year as you got half of your quarterly payments back - per agreement we will not be continuing automatic quarterly payments this year. We made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity as well as $3k of your trading losses (you have a slight amount left over that we will carry forward to next year). All in all, a nice result for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income so it was a good idea not to pay quarterlies last year.  Your wages went up $8k and your withholdings kept up.  You had some slight gains on your trades.  We made sure to note your IRA contributions in your tax return and we agreed not to pursue Roth rollovers.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Wages down a bit which means the amount you owe now is down about $20k-$25k compared to previous years but still you owe a good amount. As previously discussed would love to get you started on quarterlies I can set it up to be done automatically just let me know. I have set them at $10k per quarter for now so you can see what that would be like - given you vouchers but I can make it seamless to just be taken out of your bank account on the appropriate dates. Hope all is well - let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

You owe a good amount due to a MASSIVE $1.1MM increase in wages (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). Your withholdings kept up pretty well and of course the quarterlies really helped out. Based on this, I increased your quarterlies for next year to $30,000. You should look into a dependent care account as I believe it will benefit you given your tax situation.All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

You owe a good amount again due to another big increase of $513k in wages (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). Your withholdings kept up pretty well and of course the quarterlies again really helped out. Based on this, I increased your quarterlies for next year to $35,000. We also set you up with quarterlies of $15,000 for MA to account for the new MA millionaire's tax.


Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $63,191 by filing jointly to owing a total of $44,613, thus saving $18,578 by doing this!

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and hope all is well!

Your income, as expected, went down significantly due to retirement. You have a nice refund. If you wanted to dial back on withholdings I think you could do withholdings at 10% of distributions and social security and still be good. Let me know if you'd like to discuss.

2022

p.s. Very similar to past years - the big differences this year were you had significant medical expenses which increased your deductions and got you a bigger refund. Your refund went down by about $2k as that is due to the reduced social security withholdings compared to 2021. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

p.s. Again very similar to past years but no big medical expenses so we took the standard deduction this year which lowered your refund a bit as compared to last year. Yet still a healthy refund.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Big refund! Set up quarterlies for you based on this year but let me know if you think they should be different.

2022

p.s. You owe a good amount due to a big increase in your wages (most likely due to increased stock compensation).  Your wages went up $254k and your withholdings kept up.   You had capital gains and (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!) of $21k of short term and $8k of long term. The long term gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  You also had a HUGE increase in interest and dividends from $1k to $26k!   We increased your quarterly payments to reflect the current situation (assuming it hopefully carries forward to next year). All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

You owe a good amount due to another big increase in your wages (most likely due to increased stock compensation).  Your wages went up $776k and your withholdings kept up.   You had capital gains and (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!) of $108k of short term and we used the losses on the Vertex sales (losses after adjusting the cost basis that is to reflect taxes paid as wages) to offset these. The long term gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  You also had another HUGE increase in interest and dividends from $26k to $70k!   Our projection was spot on - a good thing.  We increased your quarterly payments to reflect the current situation (assuming it hopefully carries forward to next year) for the first 2 quarters but after that we will reassess in view of your upcoming retirement. All in all, another great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

I set Clarissa so she is NOT being claimed by you. Amount you owed went down a good bit because you got excess Social Security taxes withheld due to the job change to come back to you. Otherwise everything relatively stable although nice gains on the Moderna trade. Hope you are enjoying the new job!

2022

P.S. You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $31k (most likely due to losing the Vertex stock vesting) but your withholdings kept up. The new thing was we got you $300 credit for the energy efficient upgrades you made (that is the maximum you can get for that equipment). We also claimed Clarissa as a dependent on your return and made a note that we will do that going forward. She got you $450 dependent credit ($500 is the max and you make more than $200k so they took a little away from it). Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $59k (most likely due to the job change) but your withholdings kept up. The new thing was we got you $6,253 credit for the excess social security withholdings from switching jobs. We also claimed Clarissa as a dependent on your return and made a note that we will do that going forward. Unfortunately we can't get you a tax credit for the tuition you pay for her - you make too much money!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022
p.s. You owe a bit due to a MASSIVE gain in your wages (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  Your wages went up $304k and your withholdings mostly kept up. We got you $2k back as a credit on the electric vehicle you bought. Finally, made sure to note that you both made an extra $6k contribution to your IRAs. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Your income was down $115k last year but your withholdings stayed the same due to nice withholdings on your retirement distribution so you are back to a nice refund.

Your wages went up $97k and your withholdings kept up but not as much as we would have liked considering the amount of stock compensation in your wages (which is withheld at the average tax rate of 22%). The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that because your income was above $400k you lost the $2,000 per child tax credit (but you did get $1,200 for your 2 children).

Your income was down a bit (not good news) but the amount you owed went down as a result as well as you were now able to increase the amount of child tax credit you received.

2022

p.s. A bit similar to last year income wise - you owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $91k and your withholdings didn't keep up. The new thing that made you owe vs. last year is that you didn't have HUGE medical expenses like last year that we were able to deduct. This is a great thing of course but now you owe vs. getting a refund last year. We allocated your income properly between NH and GA and made sure to file in both states. Everything else looked good.

A bit similar to last year results wise - you owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income.

We continue to use your loss carryforwards on your trades to offset regular income - up to $3k.

Slight refunds nice! Rolled over your IRA's so set up for backdoor Roth going forward. I set up quarerlies to be paid electronically for both federal and MA based on last year's quarterlies - worked out well so think we should stick with it.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $264k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $30k federal and $300 - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a good amount due to a big increase in your wages due to a big increase in Vertex stock price making your restricted stock vesting much more valuable (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). You are now subject to the MA Millionaire's Tax and owed an extra $1k there because of it.  We could split your MA return to try to avoid that tax but the extra prep fee I would charge wouldn't make it worth it!

You paid quarterlies of $15k each and it left you a little short - therefore I set you up with $20k quarterlies for this year assuming a similar situation. You have losses on your trades after we adjusted the cost basis to make sure you weren't double taxed on your Vertex shares.  Finally, made sure to note that both of you made an extra $6.5k contribution to your IRAs and rolled them over to your Roth IRAs. Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

You had about $5k of unemployment compensation. We made sure to note your contributions of $5k for Laurie and $7k for Shady to a Roth. Everything else looks good gave you quarterlies - MA has $5 in it to signify that it's a 5% rate in MA so you can use them - just cross out that number and write what you would like to pay MA.

p.s. You would have gotten a $1,000 refund from federal and owed very little to MA without the HUGE long term capital gains of $40k on the trades (good to have gains, and they were taxed at the most favorable rate). Still having that much in gains is the reason why you owe how much you owe.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Federally you owe a bit due to gains on your trades but still - always good to have gains on your stock trades. Since you are near the income limit for IRA contributions be careful about putting it in - might be best for you to wait until we file tax return and I can tell you how much you can put in each year. Hope all is well down in VA!

Nice refunds you did a great job with the quarterlies and the business income for Chieri is coming in nicely as well. Let me know if any questions.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $17k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that SCTA made $31k more than in the previous year but the quarterly payments you made were down compared to last year (and thus the reason you owe). I recommend paying the quarterlies I've prepared for you if SCTA's income comes in the same as last year.  
We prepared your 2 separate business schedules for Chieri's blog income and Steve's Ebay sales - both combined made about $4k more than last year. We wrote off your crypto losses as worthless and used $3k of that loss this year to offset income and carried forward the remainder to use in the future. Everything else was the same as last year.

BIG refund this year as you got most of your quarterly payments back due to slightly less income - everything was the same generally speaking as last year but just a little less business income.  We took all possible tax deductions on each of your business returns, including the home office deduction.  I set you up with quarterly payments for next year based on this year's results.  Finally, made sure to take long term capital gain treatment for the royalties received by Sanja.  All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Wage Income was down about $20k last year but was made up by an increase in your business income. We made sure to get Sanja's royalties the long term capital gain treatment that they deserve. A new thing this year is that you used the standard deduction of $25,900 because it was bigger than your itemized deductions of $10k taxes plus mortgage interest of $9,668 plus your charity. Great job on the quarterlies - we set you up with similar amounts again this year assuming the same thing will occur this year. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

Another big increase from last year income wise - you owe a little more but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $54k and your withholdings didn't keep up as much as we would have liked. You are making more than $400k now so the $2,000 per child tax credit is decreased from $4,000 for your 2 children to $3,150 (and will go down even more as you make more money).  You got a $367 credit for dependent care expenses. Everything else looked good and very similar to last year. I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $3k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.

Lot of wages this year - most likely due to the Alexion takeover and stock vesting. I used the proper cost basis for all your trades so that you weren't double taxed.

P.S. Congrats again on the marriage! We provided an analysis to you which clearly shows that filing jointly is MUCH better than filing separately (and will most likely be so going forward). We also prepared your MA tax return (Emily had some wages in MA). Finally provided you with some quarterlies as Emily owed a good amount last year and this year you owe a good amount as well - I highly recommend you make quarterly payments. If you'd like me to set those up automatically for you I can do so - just please let me know BEFORE you sign so I can set it up. Thanks again - talk soon.

2023

Congrats on the new job at Alnylam! We will discuss how to maximize the ESPP there on our upcoming zoom.  We also prepared your MA tax return (Emily had some wages in MA). Finally we upped your quarterlies to $6k per quarter as your income increased substantially and without the refund of excess social security taxes of $10k withheld due to Emily's switching jobs you would have owed $13.5k to the feds.  I have set them up to be automatic again.  If you'd like me to change that for you I can do so - just please let me know BEFORE you sign so I can set it up how you would like. Thanks again - talk soon.

P.S. You had a $30k cashflow business loss but that incorporates your wages of about $70k. When we incorporate depreciation it's a much bigger loss but that's because of the big capital purchases (which will hopefully pay off over time). Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You had a big business loss after we took into account depreciation and the loss on the sale of your Alma Laser equipment.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Nice refunds! Slight losses on the trades which we were able to write off. Don't forget to up the ESPP and sell right away! Congrats again on the newborn!

2022

p.s. Nice income hit this year!

2023

Your wages were $281k and your withholdings kept up for the most part, but due to the increased value of Vertex stock vesting as well as good capital gains on the stock sales. We made sure to increase the cost basis of your Vertex stock trades so that you weren't double taxed on them. Finally we made sure to take the full mortgage interest deduction but the standard deduction is better so we took that to get you a bigger deduction. Everything else looked good and don't forget to sell the ESPP right away and also hold in this offering period when you get the email in May asking you about going forward to the next one or staying in this one - the anchor price of $350 for this period is great so hold onto it as long as possible! Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021

Slight refund to federal which is good given the level of dividends and capital gains you had last year. CA very similar to the previous year and a healthy refund. Glad we finally got the 2020 refund and the filing issue should be resolved going forward. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Filing as "Surviving Spouse" this year as it's a more favorable filing status than Head of Household. We checked and made sure that Colin's social security benefits aren't taxable. You had an IRA distribution which was taxable. Everything else looked good - nice refunds - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

We are continuing to file as "Surviving Spouse" this year as it's a more favorable filing status than Head of Household. However, this is your last year of eligibility for that filing status and next year we will file as HOH.  This would have lowered your refund to $5.5k federal and $4.8k in CA.  Still a nice refund but not as good as what you got this year.  We checked last year and again made sure not to include Colin's social security benefits as they aren't taxable. Everything else looked good - nice refunds - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2021
Nice refund again this year! I noted the $6k IRA contributions for both of you - please make sure to do them by April 18th (and complete the backdoor Roth IRA process shortly thereafter).


2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - your refund went down a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $48k and your withholdings kept up. You had capital gains this year - we used the remainder of your capital gain loss carryforwards from last year to wipe out your short term capital gains so only $2,850 of long term capital gains was taxed. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that Ann {I have attached} had some social security disability income with no withholdings.  Additionally, we made sure to note both of your $6k contributions to your IRAs and then rollover to a Roth (and make sure that it was not taxed).  Finally got you a $300 energy efficiency credit for your windows. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar yet again in all respects to last year income wise - your refund went down a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $15k and your withholdings kept up. You had capital gains this year - both short term capital gains and long term capital gains.  Finally we made sure to exclude the $5k of dependent care expenses from being taxed and got you an extra $200 of dependent care credit.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.
Client 60

2022

p.s. Great to have you back! Entered in your GBIO trades with the proper cost basis so you weren't double taxed. We carried forward your foreign tax credits from the previous return so we can use them if you ever have foreign income again. Obviously deducted your mortgage and charity. Glad we waited for the final NY Life statement as some numbers had changed. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a little but not too much given your overall income.  Your wages went down $119k and your withholdings kept up for the most part, when considering that you had almost $55k of investment income.  You had some slight gains in your trades.  We itemized to make sure you took advantage of your mortgage interest.  Talked about your incentive stock options and we agreed that we should monitor and you should reach out as needed if you are thinking of exercising.  Also talked about the home sale exclusion available to you once you sell your old place.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.
Client 61

2021

You owe a good amount due to a MASSIVE gain in your wages (probably due to the takeover I'm guessing) and some gains on the Alexion sale (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain on the Alexion sale is taxed at the short term capital gains rate.  We made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity.  The new thing this year was a rental - we set that up - it is cashflowing nicely but has a taxable loss due to depreciation.  We are preserving these losses to use in the future against future rental income.  All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. good luck in the new job!

2023

You are getting a nice refund due to a MASSIVE return of excess social security taxes withheld due to having 3 jobs of $11,111!  We made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity.  The rental is cashflowing nicely and is making money even after depreciation - nice!  We used the taxable loss from last year to offset it as much as we could.  Finally we noted your excess 401k contribution and we will amend your return for free next year to reflect that distribution you just took.  All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!
Client 62

2021
Nice refund! Just so you know you had to pay back another $4,333 of the retirement distribution from last year of $13,000 (if you recall we took advantage of special covid rules to have it be spread over 3 years) so just one more year of being taxed on that. Hope all is well!

2022
p.s. You owe due to a MASSIVE gain in your wages of about $142k (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). You also had some retirement distributions of $27k that were taxed as well.  We got you the excess social security withheld of $6,707 due to your switching jobs back, as well as a child dependent care credit of $469.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest as always. All in all, an AMAZING year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks! 

2023

Nice refund again due to less income and some nice withholdings on your wages! We reported your unemployment income.  And as always deducted your mortgage interest to helps out.  This year you got $600 for the windows, $1,200 for dependent care credit and $4,500 for all your dependents - nice!  Hope all is well and let me know if you need anything.
Client 63

2022

p.s. You make my life easy! Let's keep the quarterlies the same - let me know if you need anything or have any questions. Hope all is well....

2023

Upped the quarterlies due to increased investment income as well as a big 1st quarter payment due to cashing in some long held Treasuries.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.
Client 64- Married Filling Jointly

2021
Your income came down a bit last year and thus you are getting a good bit of your quarterly payments back for a big refund! I took your quarterly payments down to $30k per quarter for the upcoming year based on 2021 experience and set it up to be paid automatically - please let me know if you'd like to change that. Otherwise everything looks similar to last year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you are getting a little more back ($17k vs. $14k) than I originally told you because we were able to use the Ameriprise losses to offset gains on your other trades. You had some gains on your trades - all short term and we made sure to increase the cost basis on the Vertex trades so you weren't double taxed. 
Your wages went up $188k and your withholdings mostly kept up. We wrote off all your charity but had to limit your mortgage interest deduction due to the $750,000 mortgage limit cap. We agreed to keep your automatic quarterlies the same at $30 per quarter as they served us well last year.
Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and Richard feel free to reach out to me around ESPP renewal time if you'd like to discuss whether to stay in the current offering period or move to the next one.

2023

Your wages went up $660k(!) and your withholdings mostly kept up when combined with the quarterlies. You had some losses on your trades after we increases the cost basis on the Vertex trades so you weren't double taxed. We made sure to use $3k to offset regular income and preserved the rest to use going forward.  We wrote off all your charity but again had to limit your mortgage interest deduction due to the $750,000 mortgage limit cap.  We also made sure to exclude your dependent care account set aside of $5k. We agreed to increase your automatic quarterlies to $34k per quarter as they served us well last year and we need to account for more income.  The new thing is you are getting hit with the MA Millionaire's tax so we set up $1.5k quarterlies for that.  Speaking of which, we filed separately in MA and turned owing $7k to a $1k refund for a total savings of $8k!  You can see the MA filing joint tax return in your tax return which has your federal tax return for filing jointly if you want to see the difference (the MA Millionaire's tax is on Form 1 Page 3 of the MA return, line 28b.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and Richard feel free to reach out to me around ESPP renewal time if you'd like to discuss whether to stay in the current offering period or move to the next one - my personal feeling is that the anchor price for this period is AMAZING (around $350) so you should hold in the current offering period as long as possible.

2021
Income was down a bit but so is your tax owed this year so that's some consolation! Nice capital gains. Let me know if any questions thanks.

2022

p.s. You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE increase in your income from Kronos due to the options exercise (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The income was taxed as wages and the withholdings on it just didn't keep up. We again prepared business return for Chris and a rental property return for the $2k received from the boat. We also excluded the $355k gain on the sale of your home from taxation! We reported your options exercises and made sure to give you cost basis in them since they were taxed as wages (and therefore shouldn't be double taxed). Finally, made sure to prepare state returns for both MA and RI and allocate all your trades properly between them. I hope you are doing well in RI - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Again you owe a good amount due to another big gain on sales of your Kronos stock (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The income was taxed as long term capital gains at the most favorable rate. Made sure to report all your other trades and interest and wages.  I hope you are enjoying the ocean in RI - the Ocean State!  Let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Congrats on retirement! You owe a lot but we already discussed why. i'd advise withholding on any future retirement distributions at 22% federal rate and 5% MA. I kept your quarterly payments the same considering that. Everything else looked good - congrats again on the retirement and home renovation - all exciting stuff!

Just shy of $100k! Anyways you had a great year income wise glad you're prepared for it. Pleasure as always!

2022

p.s. Another great year income wise for you - almost broke the $1MM mark! You owe a good amount but not much considering your overall income and the quarterly payment definitely helped. I set up quarterlies for next year based on the past year and will send them to you for your convenience.
We reported all your Vertex trades and made sure to increase the cost basis so that you weren't double taxed on any trades. We also reported Delilah as a dependent and made sure to report her child care expenses so they weren't taxable. Finally we included Kate's new business and took all possible deductions. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Your income was down a bit (about $135k) wage wise but you are still making a great income.  Again - you owe a good amount but not much considering your overall income. Quarterly payments would definitely help - I advised quarterlies for next year of $7,500 based on the past year and set them up to happen automatically on the appropriate dates.

We made sure to get you the maximum $1,200 energy efficiency tax credit.  We also reported Delilah and Andrew as dependents and made sure to report the Girl Scouts child care expenses so they weren't taxable. Finally we included Kate's business income. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Holy refund! Cory going back to school really helped your return as it pushed more of Joe's income in to a lower tax bracket. We made sure to get $2,000 for the lifetime learning credit for the tuition paid for school last year as well. All in all a great result - congrats!

2022


p.s.  Very similar to last year income wise - another great refund! Your wages went up $30k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you get about $3k less of a refund this year vs last was because the covid stimulus of $1,400 per person that you got in 2021 is no longer available. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar YET AGAIN in all respects - another great refund - almost the same as last years! Your wages went up $28k and your withholdings kept up. You had slight gains in your trades - all long term. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022


p.s. Very similar to last year as far as the overall story goes - you are owing a bit more but your quarterly payment really helped and you don't owe any tax penalties. However you had a MASSIVE INCREASE in wages - they went up $293k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. You had some gains on your trades - all short term and we made sure to increase the cost basis on the Vertex trades so you weren't double taxed.  
We filed in NH because you had investment income there that we have to pay tax on. Your work from home in MA meant a good portion of your Vertex earnings weren't taxed in MA - nice! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and talk soon.

2023

Very similar YET AGAIN to last year as far as the overall story goes - you are owing a bit more but your quarterly payment really helped and you only owe $33 in tax penalties. However you had a MASSIVE INCREASE in wages - they went up $219k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. You had some losses  on your trades - all short term and we made sure to increase the cost basis on the Vertex trades so you weren't double taxed.

You made a LOT more money in your business last year (good thing) but now you owe taxes on it (bad thing). Last year you made 60k - this year you made 100k. Additionally an extra 30k of retirement distributions from Jackson Life and about $7k in debt forgiveness all added up to why you owe. You can put up to an additional $8,446 into your SEP IRA - this would save you $1,485 in taxes (so about 18 cents of every dollar you put in). Both the SEP IRA and regular IRA were nice deductions this year. Please book a zoom and we can discuss thanks.

JENNA THEY HAVE TO PAY AN INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT IT'S IN THE SIGNATURE PAGES IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT. THEY HAVE 6 YEARS TO PAY WHAT THEY OWE AND IT'S AUTOMATICALLY APPROVED IF THE AMOUNT THEY OWE IS BELOW $25K
p.s. Good seeing you again! We set up the installment agreement as you requested.

Big refund as predicted! I attached the Form 1098 to your tax return because it's such a big deduction I just wanted to provide the IRS proof of it (but they should have it in their system as well). Susan's business is doing well and good retirement distributions - everything else looks great. Please let me know when you want to come by to pick up your original tax documents - thanks.

2022

p.s. Another big refund! No wage income as you retired so income was down significantly year over year. Susan's business income was down by $18k as well. Increased retirement distributions as you should have and the withholdings were great on them. We deducted all your mortgage interest (a LOT LESS this year!) and charity. I think this will be your new "normal". Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a good amount due to a MASSIVE increase in wages due to Susan going back to work combined with an increase in both investment and business income.  We made sure that only 85% of your social security earnings were taxed.  Susan's business income was up slightly year over year and still bringing in good money.  Finally, made sure to note that Susan needs to take her RMD from 2022 immediately and we will deal with it in 2024.  Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Great job with the ISO exercises - I know there's pain now but as long as the stock price stays up you did the right thing!

p.s. PHEW! All done - reported the trades from Roche - glad we waited or else you would have gotten a big bill from the IRS! I've noted in your file to wait from now on until March and make sure to ask for a 1099-B reporting trades, but you should make note of that too just in case I forget!
We made sure to increase your cost basis on the options trade so that you pay zero tax on it (as you paid tax through your wages). Also split your other trade into 2 to properly report short and long term capital gains (and found the proper cost basis of course).
Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Nice job on the withholdings - MASSIVE refund coming your way!  We reported the trade from Roche and made sure to adjust the cost basis correctly! We tried to get you QSBS treatment on your Klaviyo shares but determined you don't qualify - bummer.  Still you have a good amount of wealth there which is nice.  You got $4k in AMT tax credits back this year and there are about $42k left to go - we will track that for you to use in the future.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and thanks again for the referrals to Klaviyo employees let them know I know about QSBS and ISOs!  :)

Nice year for you income wise! You had a $35k income boost due to ISO exercise, which is the main reason you owed both federally and MA as there are no withholdings on that income in your W2. Still it's always better to have a gain!


2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - however you get a nice refund this year due to $2,000 child tax credit for Alaric and your new filing status as Head of Household! Your wages went down $8k but your withholdings kept up. We of course made sure to deduct your mortgage interest. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023
BIG refund this year again due to your wages being down a good bit (due to less stock compensation flowing through your W2 for options exercises) and lower capital gains income. Further, you got a $2600 tax credit for energy improvements due to your home renovation.  We of course made sure to deduct your mortgage interest. Everything else looked good.

ANDY THERE IS FBAR SIGNATURES IN HERE MAKE SURE TO SEND THEM AS WELL THANKS. Big year for you income wise. You owe a bit more than last year ($68k vs $31k) but it makes sense given the level of income you are at and that sell to cover doesn't withhold at a high enough rate given that income. If you expect this to remain the same going forward I'd like to set you up on $17,500 quarterlies - I can set this up to be paid automatically for you if you want - just let me know. Finally I made sure to put your foreign tax credit in and got you $17,500 in credit for your foreign taxes paid. Thanks again - pleasure working with you - let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $64k and your withholdings kept up relatively speaking. You had many Vertex sales - we made sure to properly increase the cost basis on all of them so that you paid minimal tax on them. We also used the capital loss carryforwards from last year to offset these gains on your trades. For the rentals, Broadstairs was very similar to last year while we properly reported Maidenhead as being partially rented and partially occupied by both of you.
The new thing that we dealt with this year (for the first and final time!) was your voluntary expatriation back to the UK. We made sure to check that you weren't a long term resident and thus not subject to an "exit tax". We also made sure to file a Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for your foreign accounts to make sure he is in compliance with that reporting requirement. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.
Client 79

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your had wage income - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $30k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is because the withholdings on that income is at 10% (the lowest amount) whereas you're in the 22% tax bracket due to your business income. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. Your business income went up $14k from 2021. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $2,500 to federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Finally deducted the losses on your trades to the maximum $3,000. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.   

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your business income went down by $35k to having you making $23k net income - thus you are getting a $6k refund! Do you think your business income will be the same next year? If so, I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $1.5k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

ANDY DID TAX RETURNS FOR HER CHILD REBECCA GU - PLEASE GO THERE AND SEND SIGNATURES AND TAX RETURN FOR HER TO BO FENG Big gain this year due to sale of rental property and depreciation recapture. We did take accumulated losses on the rental but they weren't enough to significantly offset the gain. Additionally made sure to take offsetting tax credit in MA to get you credit for the tax paid in CT.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe about the same amount as last year but for different reasons. Your wages went up $203k(!!!) and your withholdings just didn't keep up.  You had $33k of long term capital gains on your trades (good to have gains, and they were taxed at the most favorable rate). Still having that much in gains added about $9k to your tax burden between federal and MA. Finally we prepared Eric's tax return and made sure to get him the refund he deserves as well as noted his Roth contribution. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021

You owe a good amount this year but it's very similar to last year.  You had some gains on your trades but they were minimal - the real driver of why you owe is due to stock compensation.  I set you up with $7,000 quarterlies let me know if you'd like me to set it up to be paid automatically - I can do that through my software. Everything else looks good and as discussed previous tax returns look good as well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - your wage income went down only $4k - you owe a bit but not too much considering where you were last year and your overall income level. Your $21k of stock gains were taxed as long term capital gains (the most favorable rate). I highly recommend quarterlies for the upcoming year as last year you owed a good amount - I recommend $8k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went UP A LOT (almost $200k) but the amount you owed went down - nice!  You owe a bit but not too much considering where you were last year and your overall income level. We made sure to exclude the $170k on the sale of your home.  Additionally excluded the retirement distributions as you rolled them back into IRAs within the 60 day window.  Finally made sure to itemize to take advantage of your mortgage interest.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Great year for you income wise! Hardly owe anything - right on track - everything looks great!

2022

p.s. You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $75k and your withholdings and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 32% tax bracket. Everything else looked good but as your stock compensation increases this will probably continue to be what you owe. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You only owe a little bit which is great considering you made a good amount still last year.  A big increase in Vertex stock price making your restricted stock vesting much more valuable (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). You have short term capital losses  on your trades after we adjusted the cost basis to make sure you weren't double taxed on your Vertex shares and we made sure to deduct the maximum $3k against your regular income and will carry forward the rest to next year.  We also noted the unemployment income.  Finally, congrats again on Finley and just to let you know she gave you an extra $2k child tax credit - nice!  Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Finally some REFUNDS - great job with the quarterlies! I brought the automatic quarterlies down to $10k and $3k between fed and CT respectively based on this year. The rental is cashflowing nicely and we used previous year's losses to offset the $2k income from the rental. You had some losses on your trades but we were able to use $3k of those losses to reduce normal taxable income and we are carrying forward the losses to next year in case you have gains then. Please set up a zoom so we can go over and talk about the hybrid work situation for 2022 - thanks!

2022

p.s. Another great job with the quarterlies - although you owe a bit it's nothing like you would have owed without them and you avoided tax penalties! I brought the automatic quarterlies up to $12.5k and $2.5k between fed and CT respectively based on this year. The rental is cashflowing nicely yet again. You had some gains on your trades but we were able to use loss carryforwards to zero them out and then use $3k of those losses to reduce normal taxable income and we are carrying forward the remaining losses to next year in case you have gains then. Finally, we made sure you got credit in CT for all the taxes you paid to MA (and filed in both states). Good stuff - keep it up (and keep that ESPP % up)!!

2023

You owe a good amount due to a big increase in your wages due to a big increase in Vertex stock price making your restricted stock vesting much more valuable (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). You are now almost at $1MM!!!  Rental had a slight loss after expenses.

You paid quarterlies of $12.5k each and it left you a little short - therefore I set you up with $17.5k quarterlies for this year assuming a similar situation. You have gains on your trades after we adjusted the cost basis to make sure you weren't double taxed on your Vertex shares.  Keep that ESPP rolling to the max - this period is a particularly good period for it!  (Also make sure to HOLD in this ESPP period when you get the email asking if you want to stay in this period or roll forward to the new ESPP period as the 11/15/23 anchor price is super low).  

Finally, made sure to note that both of you made an extra $7.5k contribution to your IRAs and rolled them over to your Roth IRAs. Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Slight losses in your trades last year when adjusted for proper cost basis so that you aren't double taxed.  This isn't necessarily the best news but it means you are getting a refund this year. Everything else looks good we wrote off the trading losses of $213 against regular income and are deducting your charity. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Big increase last year income wise - you owe a little bit but not much considering your overall income. You had some gains on your trades - all short term and we made sure to increase the cost basis on the Vertex trades so you weren't double taxed.  
Your wages went up $126k and your withholdings mostly kept up. We made sure that your conversion to a Roth IRA was NOT taxed.
Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar to last year both income and results wise. Your wages went up $35k  - you owe a little bit but not much considering your overall income.

Nice refunds! You took full advantage of the increased dependent care limits to reduce your taxable income as well as had some more nice gains on your stock trades. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - your wages went up $36k and your withholdings kept up but still your refund went down just about $2k due to increased stock vesting. You had some slight losses in your trades and we made sure to deduct them (and increase the cost basis appropriately). Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar to last year income wise - your wages went up $35k and your withholdings kept up for the most part. You had some long term gains of about $18k in your Vertex trades and we made sure to increase the cost basis appropriately so you weren't double taxed on them but still this is the reason you owe this year.

2023

BIG refund this year as you got most of your quarterly payments back due to your wages being down a good bit (about $322k) but mostly because we increased the AMT cost basis for your Intellia stock options sales to get you $94k back!  We reported all the Intellia trades which showed a big long term gain but again you paid upfront in AMT taxes so now you get some of that back.  Megan's business did great up another $13k.  I brought your automatic quarterly payments for next year to $40k per quarter to reflect the current situation as you may not get this AMT tax credit again next year.  We also filed separately in MA to save you a lot!  Specifically you saved $3,388 by doing this!  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Nice refund! No trades this year resulted in this good refund. I set you up for automatic quarterly payments of $6,000 based on this but let me know if you think we should increase that (if you think you have some big gains coming this year). Thanks again - hope all is well with you guys!

2022

p.s. AGAIN with a MASSIVE refund! No trades this year resulted in this good refund. You made less than $400k this year so you actually got the $2k child tax credit for Maisie - sweet! I set you up for automatic quarterly payments of $2,000 based on this and our discussion. Thanks again - hope all is well with you guys!

2023

Nice "gentle" refund this year due to small quarterlies - kept you on the same for this year.  Your investment income was up by $19k this year - nice!

Your wages are up almost $30k which is obviously great. Your interest and dividends are still coming in at a healthy rate and we accounted for the new trust form. A full year's worth of mortgage interest allows us to itemize and get almost $5k more of a tax deduction than last year to get you an even bigger refund than last year! Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages are up almost $75k which is obviously great - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your interest and dividends are still coming in at a healthy rate and we accounted for the trust form which also had great dividends. A full year's worth of mortgage interest on both houses allows us to itemize and get almost $3k more of a tax deduction than last year. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages are down about $44k compared to last year - not necessarily good but you now have a slight refund! A big jump in your mortgage interest paid helped out there as well.

Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

The bad news is you had significant losses on your trades last year. The good news is it COMPLETELY wiped out your big gain on the Vertex sale as well as gave you a credit on health insurance premiums paid so you have a refund. Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Nice trading gains you're back in the black! We used last year's losses to wipe out a lot of it and the rest was subject to a zero tax rate because it was long term capital gains. The bad news is you had significant losses on your trades last year. So it gave you a credit on health insurance premiums paid again so you have a refund again! Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a good amount due to a MASSIVE gain on your Vertex shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  Your alimony is a nice deduction which we continue to take and helps reduce the amount you owe.  Everything else looked good.  Hope you are well and that driveway doesn't overtake you!  Let me know if any questions - thanks!
Client 92 - Married Filling Jointly

2021
You owe a bit less than previous years on the federal side. You owe $5k to MA and that's mainly because of the capital gains (short term gets taxed at 125). Still - great to have capital gains! Good job with the backdoor Roth conversions keep that up. Let me know if any questions thanks.

2022


p.s. Great job with the quarterlies - although you owe a good amount it's nothing like you would have owed without them and you avoided tax penalties! I brought the automatic quarterlies up to $15k based on this year. Your wages went up $518k (WWWWOOOWWW!!) and your withholdings obviously couldn't keep up which is why the quarterlies were good. You had some gains on your trades but mostly long term. We made sure to make your backdoor Roth conversions non-taxable and to deduct your mortgage interest and charity. Everything else looked good. Good stuff - keep it up (and keep that ESPP % up)!!

2023

Another great job with the quarterlies - although you owe a good amount it's nothing like you would have owed without them and you avoided tax penalties! I brought the automatic quarterlies up to $19.5k based on this year. Your wages went down a bit but your investment income went up which is why the quarterlies were good. You had some gains on your trades but mostly long term. We made sure to make your backdoor Roth conversions non-taxable and to deduct your mortgage interest and charity but took the standard deduction because it was more than the itemized deductions.  Everything else looked good. Good stuff - keep it up (and keep that ESPP % up this period is particularly good with a low anchor price and when you get the email asking if you want to stay in this current ESPP period or roll forward to the next one I think you should stay in this one as the anchor price on November 15th is so low)!!

ANDY THIS IS A BUSINESS. INVOICE AMOUNT IS $1,800 AND JUST HAVE PATRICK HALLIGAN SIGN THANKS As you have probably expected, Happy Feet had slight losses in 2021, but was largely not active last year. The losses are primarily driven by some of the fixed expenses that you have to pay (such as quickbooks fees, taxes, etc.). Hopefully the business picks up again as the spring returns and kids are back to the outdoor activities and people are not as much concerned with Covid.

Great refund - good luck with the bathroom renovation!

2022

p.s. Very similar to TWO years ago income wise - you owe about the same as then but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $247k as Samuel went back to W2 work and your withholdings went up but obviously your quarterlies went down. You had some gains on your trades which we reported. The rental was very similar to last year. Please remember you can only do $5k to dependent care account per family - the excess of $6,490 was added back as taxable wages. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income continues to go up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $56k and your withholdings didn't keep up.  There were tax penalties (aka interest) of $549 due to you having been underwithheld throughout the year.  Therefore I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $6k federal and set them up for you - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Your rental was very steady - same result.  You had slight losses on your trades and we made sure to deduct them.  Finally you are both contributing $5k to a dependent care account but the maximum PER FAMILY is $5k so one of you should stop contributing as it just becomes taxable now (with no tax withholdings on it).  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Congrats on the new home - I have heard great things about Newburyport - hope you're enjoying it! You had slight losses on your trading gains which we used to offset your capital gains distributions. You still owe due to having a good amount of wage income - please call me to discuss as I can explain my thoughts on this. Talk soon.

2022

p.s. Great result we were spot on with the quarterly payments! You had great income last year and between the withholdings and the payments we kept you right on track. You had good capital gains - $42k long and $67k short. No mortgage sweet! Also means not itemizing anymore but your standard deduction is still good. Everything else looked good.  
You'll notice I upped your fee a good bit this year - my client minimum is now $750 and you are a good bit more complex than that! I hope you are ok with it but please let me know if you'd like to discuss. Hope you are enjoying Newburyport - talk soon!

2023

Great result as we were AGAIN spot on with the quarterly payments! You had great income last year and between the withholdings and the payments we kept you right on track. You had good capital gains - $2k long and $24k short. We made sure to report Dave's MyPoints income as well and zeroed out the LiveNation 1099-K.  Everything else looked good.

More wage income and higher gains on trades - however you get to itemize due to mortgage interest so that helped get you a federal refund. You owe in MA because of the gains on the trades. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. More wage income of $82k but your withholdings kept up. You again get to itemize due to a full year's worth of mortgage interest and some GREAT charity so that helped get a much bigger federal refund. Everything else looked good. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Your wages went down a bit and your withholdings didn't keep up. We made sure to record your trades and your crypto as well so you got losses we were able to deduct.  You again get to itemize due to a full year's worth of mortgage interest and charity so that helped lower your tax bill. We also noted your backdoor Roth conversion.  Finally I would recommend doing quarterly payments of $3,000 or increasing your withholdings to avoid owing this much next year.  If you'd like to do the quarterlies just let me know and I can set them up.  Everything else looked good. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. MASSIVE increase in your wage income. Similarly massive increase in your refund. Vertex trades (there were many!) cost basis input correctly so you weren't double taxed. Back to the drawing board for next year.....glad to see you're doing so well.

2023

BIG letdown this year by the model as I was shocked at the amount you were off - back to the drawing board!  The good news is you're millionaires!  We reported all your trades and increased the cost basis so you weren't double taxed.  There were losses on these trades so we used the maximum amount of $3,000 to offset regular income and then will carry forward the rest to use in the future.  We also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  It wasn't as much as we projected originally because filing separately makes your dependent account taxable.  Still you went from owing $259 by filing jointly to getting a refund of $2,938, thus saving $3,197 by doing this!  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well and as always let me know if any questions - thanks!

Client 102 - Married Filling Jointly

2021

All's well that ends well! You owe a LOT in taxes due to the $484k gain in the ISO trade, but properly reporting it as wages instead of as short term capital gains saved you about $48k in taxes. For the rental, we properly carried over your losses from last year and input all your expenses for this year so you are still showing a loss. Your invoice reflects the extra time I had to put in dealing with the W2 issue and the upfront deposit you paid (basically I charged an extra $500 for my extra time). Please let me know if any questions on any of this. Thanks - pleasure working with you.

2022

p.s. Same story as last year and same resolution! We made sure to have the ISO trade for $72k that was an exercise and sale reported as wages, saving you over $10k in taxes! However, you owe a LOT in taxes due to the $417k "phantom" gain on the ISO trade where you exercised and held as it is "bargain income" and subject to AMT taxes. We will make sure to track this amount of tax paid and we can use it when you do ultimately sell these shares in the future. For the ISO shares you exercised and sold we made sure you paid nothing in capital gains on them (as they were taxed as wages)
For the original rental, we properly carried over your losses from last year and input all your expenses for this year so you are still showing a loss. We do have a new rental in a new state so we created a schedule for that as well as a new state tax return. Please let me know if any questions on any of this. Thanks - pleasure working with you again.

2023

You owe a LOT less than last year and yet still you owe a good amount - this is mostly due to the $114k of retirement distributions for Neeraj that didn't have any withholdings on it.   We made sure to have it taxed in MD as that is where you were living when it was taken out.  For the rentals, we properly carried over your losses from last year and input all your expenses for this year so you are still showing a loss for both of them - however moving into the rental limits the loss to the revenues earned from the rental over the year. We made sure to create 2 part year resident returns and allocate your income properly for each of them.  Finally reminded you that Baltimore has a local tax and you should withhold for it.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions on any of this. Thanks and hope all is well with you!

We got you the unemployment repayment deducted as an itemized deduction which saved you a good amount on your taxes. You made some very good money through your rental so that added to your tax burden. All in all though you ended up with a slight refund and you are set up for future years now that we have set up the rental portion of your property. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Last year we got you the unemployment repayment deducted as an itemized deduction which saved you a good amount on your taxes and gave you a refund, but this year you didn't have that so you owe slightly compared to last year. Again, you made some very good money through your rental so that added to your tax burden. All in all though you only ended up owing slightly. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021
BIG refund this year again as you got most of your quarterly payments back due to Tonia shutting down her business halfway through the year. We took all possible tax deductions on Tonia's business return, including the home office deduction. I obviously did not set you up with quarterly payments for next year as Tonia has shut down her business. Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest but the refinance led to it being lower this year by about $5k. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well and congrats again on Maggie- let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. No business income for Tonia but a big jump in wages (about $240k) with no quarterly payments led to you owing about $25k this year. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and taxes paid to the extent possible. Normally I would recommend quarterly payments but given the situation it's best to forgo that for now and then when things settle down you should reach out to me and we can talk about that (and anything else you want). Hope you're doing ok - let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

2023

Tough year for you but you still ended up ahead wage income wise.  Your wages went up about $60k and your withholdings remained a little bit behind last year - you would have owed $32k but you got $10k back for excess social security withholdings due to having multiple jobs.  We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and taxes paid to the extent possible. I recommend quarterly payments if you think your income will be the same so let's discuss that as well as your SVB stock situation when you reach out to me and we can talk about that (and anything else you want). Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

Wages were up a good amount as well as your business income.  We added Amanda's business and took all possible deductions to use to offset your regular income.  There was unemployment income as well which made your income way more (about $64k) than previous years.  Still you had good withholdings and quarterly payments and thus owe a minimal amount relative to your income.

Lot more wage income this year but withholdings on it was pretty good. The federal quarterly payments helped but obviously no payments in MA leaves you owing there. I set up electronic quarterly payments for BOTH fed and MA this year based on 2021 results so should make things very straightforward for next year. Lots of crypto trades - hope you are making some good money! Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your business and grant income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $17k and your withholdings kept up. Your business income was up $54k while your grant income was up $45k. The good news is that the quarterly payments really helped out! That said they weren't enough to get you to breakeven so I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. We made sure to max your available SEP IRA contribution to reduce what you owe. Finally we accounted for your crypto trades. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your business went up a good amount (about $49k)- you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down a similar $49k and your withholdings kept up. Your grant income stayed the same at $61k. The good news, once again, is that the quarterly payments really helped out and made it some you owed a minimal amount come time to extend your tax return.

p.s. Slight refund this year as your wages stayed similar to 2021. While business income was down it led to less tax owed which is why you got a slight refund. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

You owe a slight amount this year as your wages went up more than $70k while your withholdings kept pace. Richard's business income was the same as last year.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $16k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that Beth had some retirement distribution income with 10% federal withholdings but you are in the 24% tax bracket so that was a bit underwithheld. But the good news is that this was tax free in MA! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Your wages went down $38k and your withholdings kept up when compared to last year. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you sold your land in Maine - we deducted your sales expenses as well as the cost of the land but still there was $22k of long term capital gains there you had to pay tax on.  We had to create a Maine state tax return there for this sale so you owe there but we made sure to get you credit for that in MA so you weren't double taxed on that income in the state tax returns.  

Beth continues to have good retirement income with 10% federal withholdings but you are in the 24% tax bracket so again that was a bit underwithheld but the good news (again) is that this is tax free in MA! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. No more wage income (nice hope you are enjoying no longer working for the man!). You're both taking retirement distributions and your withholdings are spot on. The new thing this year is Jeanne has a business return (Schedule C) - we created it and took all possible deductions on this schedule (this is also why your fee went up this year due to this extra work). Everything else looked similar to last year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Congrats on the new place! A lot better year for you tax wise - you owe a lot lot less! I adjusted your Schrodinger trade cost basis so you didn't have to pay taxes on the huge gain reported by the broker. You also got to deduct all that mortgage interest. All in all a great year for you.

2022

p.s. Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news (probably due to lower value of stock options exercised). That said, it means you have a refund this year - finally! We increased the basis of the Schrodinger trade to reflect the wages paid on the gain so there's no gain on the stock trade. We continue to deduct mortgage interest that's a nice deduction for you. Everything else looks good. Let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Wages were up almost $20k last year and withholdings kept up - nice!  The refund this year is almost the same as last year nice again! We increased the basis of the Schrodinger trades to reflect the wages paid on the gain but there wer still gains on the stock trades but that's ok as you made good money on them. We continue to deduct mortgage interest that's a nice deduction for you. Everything else looks good. Let me know if any questions - thanks. 

P.s.  Thanks for the referral to Mel and Wes!

p.s. Losses on the trades from LPL reduced the amount you owed - nice! Great seeing you as always!

2023

Great seeing you Cara and we missed you Chris!  And welcome Cammie to the family!  You make too much to have her save you money federally but on the state she got you an extra $50 sweet!  We talked about it and made sure to have you put $5k towards a dependent care account for her daycare expenses.  Massive mortgage interest brought down what you owed by $7k.  Set you up on automatic quarterlies to help you avoid a big bill and paying penalty interest next year.  Everything else looked good - pleasure as always!

You owe slightly but not too bad given the amount of income you had. Let me know if any questions thanks.

2022


p.s. Allie owes a LOT due to a large amount of income that came in due to her work with her grandmother's estate. The income is taxed as other income so it will not be subject to self-employment taxes (as it's obviously not a business). Joe getting a slight refund - we reported all business income and took all possible deductions against this income. Also Joe please reach out as stated on the phone when getting serious about starting to go out on your own for good. All in all, a great year for you both - let me know if any questions - thanks! 

2023

You owe very little to MA based on your investment income.  Nothing owed to federal and we made sure to itemize on your federal return so that Joe could itemize too and take advantage of all the deductions your family has.  Hope all is well!  Let me know if you have any questions thanks.

Nice refund this year again as you did great with your quarterly payments - we have made sure to apply the refund to next year's estimates.  I have set quarterlies for next year taking account last year's situation but it may be different with just investment income - we should meet to discuss sometime in May - please book a zoom with me for then.    Great capital gains - all long term.  We took all possible tax deductions with mortgage interest and charity.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well and congrats again on the move back to MA - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. MONSTER refund this year! As discussed, we have made sure to apply $5,000 of the federal refund to the next year and ALL of the MA refund to next year. I have run a projection thinking you will owe $5k to fed and $15k to MA - we should meet to discuss sometime in November once you have all your income - please book a zoom with me then.  We took all possible tax deductions with mortgage interest and charity.Good seeing you again and hope you are enjoying MA - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

As discussed, we have made sure to apply $3,000 of the federal refund to the next year and ALL of the MA refund to next year. I have run a projection thinking you will owe $3k to fed and $12k to MA - we should meet to discuss sometime in November once you have all your income - please book a zoom with me then.  Your wages were down $272k last year and will fall even further next year with no more TVA W2.  That said your retirement distributions have ramped up to give you some good income.  We took all possible tax deductions with mortgage interest and charity.  Please note charity is also deductible in MA so an extra 5% back there for you!  Let me know if any questions - hope enjoying retirement - talk soon - thanks!

Your wage income was up a lot last year. Unfortunately the withholdings didn't keep up and you're back to owing - not as much as previous years but still - not the refund of last year. You got $563 for the charger credit. Please let me know if any questions, and hope you're well!

2022

Your wage income was up a lot AGAIN last year - nearly $132k. Unfortunately the withholdings didn't keep up and you're still owing a good amount - it would have been almost $18k but you got $9k back for excess social security contributions for having two jobs last year. We made sure to properly increase the cost basis on your Thermo Fisher trade. You had losses in your other trade so we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Your wage income was down a lot this year - nearly $238k. Fortunately it's because you started a business and you as the boss decided not to pay yourself that much!  You had gains in your trades which were all long term - the best tax rate you can get. Finally talked with you about QSBS which would be a great deduction for you in the future.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

As discussed, perfect with the quarterlies! Therefore going to continue with them as you anticipate more trading gains this year. We were able to exclude the gain on your home to the maximum saving you almost $65k! Everything else looked good. Congrats again on Jacob and please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Again, perfect with the quarterlies! Therefore going to continue with them as you probably will contine to have the same or even more wage and trading income this year. Next year get ready to get hit with the MA millionaire's tax - there's no way around it for you unless your wage income drops. Not a big deal as it will get taken directly out of your paycheck but anyways it's an extra 4% on income above $1MM. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

2023

As discussed we were a little light with the quarterlies last year but not a big deal as you didn't get hit with any penalty interest due to making timely quarterlies.  We have upped the quarterlies for this year to $22k to reflect the new reality.  As predicted this year you got hit with the MA millionaire's tax which was an extra 4% on income above $1MM. 

Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $1,758 by actually getting a refund filing separately of $792, thus saving $2,540 by doing this!  This is a bit less than we thought because of the way some married filing separately income gets treated once we split it, but you still saved more than $1,000 after our tax prep fee.

We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Finally we made sure to get you $600 child care credit.

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks and glad to get you a good result!

BIG refund this year as you got big child tax credits as well as dependent care credit. Lower wages helped increase the refund. All in all, a great year tax wise for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Wages understandably down but continue to have great refunds! Took every deduction and credit we could. Reported the $3,000 of externship income. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2022

p.s. Nice refunds again this year!  The refund was down a little bit due to the job switch which both increased your earnings and also decreased your withholdings a little bit.  But that's ok because you saw much more in your paycheck through the year - a good thing!  Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

SHOWING YOU THE MONEY YEAR AFTER YEAR!! You have significant interest this year from Treasuries. You are taking the standard deduction now because that is larger than your mortgage interest plus charity plus $10k of SALT taxes. Everything else the same. Refund lower a bit because you got some of the child tax credit upfront. Good thing you spent 5 hours getting that. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. You owe a good amount this year but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $17k but your withholdings didn't keep up - I think it's a combination of being in a new job and your new Single filing status this year. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Basically the same as last year except you owe $1.2k more due to more wages at a higher bracket.  You owe a good amount this year but not too much considering your overall income.

We were able to exclude the entire $700k gain on the sale of risQ stock by using the QSBS exclusion, which saved you from paying $162k on the federal level. Not only that, but we excluded half of the QSBS stock gain on the MA level, and were allowed to have the remaining half taxed at 3% instead of 5%. This saved you from paying $35k on the state level! Everything else was normal when compared to previous year. I set up the payments to federal and MA to automatically come out of the bank account you gave us on April 18th. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year except you owe a LOT less to MA! Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

2023

Similar to last year wage income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $75k and your withholdings kept up for the most part.  We reported Auroop's side income properly, including creating a Schedule E for the royalties. The new thing was Shree's business - we added that and took all available deductions.  This reduced the amount you owed in taxes by $972. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

A lot of income this year due to stock exercises, etc. The amount owed can be paid out of bank account whatever date you want. I adjusted your trades to increase the cost basis so that you aren't double taxed on income you reported on your W2. Please let me know if any questions thanks.

2022

p.s. Nice little refund for you! Set up your return to be Married Filing Separately and we used the standard deduction - even though it's slightly less advantageous for you it only cost you about $600. You are claiming Joshua and we claimed dependent care expenses for him which got you $526. We prepared your gift tax return for both Joshua and Abigail and made sure you didn't use any of your estate tax exclusion as the gift was extended over 5 years. You have to mail it in - please be sure to sign and send via registered mail, return receipt requested. Everything else looked good - please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Great refund this year! Set up your return to be Head of Household and we used the itemized deduction to make sure to take advantage of your mortgage interest and charity. You are claiming Abigail and we claimed dependent care expenses for her which got you $392. We also got you energy efficient tax credits of $3,200 and excess social security of $2,811 for working two jobs.  Everything else looked good - please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Good federal refund! You owe in MA because of the 1099-R we discussed. Glad to hear you're enjoying Plymouth....

2022
p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you are getting a good federal refund but owe in MA due to Thrift Savings not withholding on state taxes. Your retirement distributions went up $22k and your federal withholdings kept up. The new thing this year was you went back to work! We made sure to take all possible deductions and the home office made it so that none of your court reporter income was taxed. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Very similar to last year again - except this time much less retirement distributions means your withholdings led to an even bigger fed return!  Your MA withholdings on the retirement being low just meant you owing a bit there.  We took some great deductions including the home office deduction to make your business income as low as possible.  Welcome back to retirement!  Hope all is well!
Client 126

BIG refund this year as you got $2,000 child tax credit (half of which was paid upfront last year) as well as dependent care credit of $3,600.  Finally, made sure to itemize to deduct your mortgage interest.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Almost exactly the same as last year but your refund went down due to the 1099-R distribution of $17k. It's still ok as you can obviously use those proceeds but just letting you know why the refund was lower this year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well.

2023

BIG refund again this year just like 2021 as you got $2,000 child tax credit and had some great withholdings on your W2.  Advised you of how great this ESPP period is as well.  All in all, another great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

You owe a LOT due to Craig's business income bringing in good money this year - you would have only owed $5k to federal without it.   We got you every deduction we could on his business.  We also got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to Lauren's switching jobs back.  Finally, we set up quarterlies for you for next year based on Craig's business income from last year.  All in all, a great year for you - exciting to have your own business - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year business income wise - with the quarterlies you are getting a good refund! We discussed quarterlies for the upcoming year and you stated no need since this year will be more straightforward. Your wages went down a good bit.  You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. You got an extra $2k child tax credit for Charlotte - nice! Finally, we made sure to take your mortgage interest to its full extent - a nice deduction for you. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

No business income this year and no quarterlies means you owe a little bit but not much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $132k and your withholdings kept up.You got $4k in child tax credits for the kids and an extra $1,200 for dependent care expenses - nice! Finally, we made sure to take your mortgage interest to its full extent - a nice deduction for you. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Allie owes hardly anything as she had very little income. Joe owes as his business income is up by $18k and investment income is up $14k.  For the business we reported all business income and took all possible deductions against this income. Joe would have owed a lot more but got almost $9k back due to excess social security withholdings through having 3 jobs.  Also Joe please make sure to file the BOI report as Green Oak is not responsible for that.

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $14k and your withholdings kept up.  Roz's business income was up $2.5k from last year and this helps explain the increase in what you owe year over year.  The new thing we added was a new Schedule C to report the clothing resales and cost of goods sold and made sure that wasn't taxable.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

p.s. Big jump last year income wise - you owe a little bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $86k and your withholdings kept up. No more business so we removed that from your return. We made sure to calculate the tax owed in NY and NYC and you still ended with a slight refund there. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Another big jump last year income wise - you owe a good amount and I think it's due to having multiple W2s. Your wages went up $134k and your withholdings didn't keep up. We reported your trades and since they were losses we were allowed to deduct them on your return (up to the $3k maximum limit).

Everything remained almost exactly the same as the previous year except you have less mortgage interest (a good thing) which means you take the standard deduction now instead of itemize as the standard deduction is higher than your state and real estate tax paid (capped at $10,000) and mortgage interest combined.  You did great with the dependent care account in maxxing it out and we made sure it wasn't taxed.  Let me know if any questions - thanks!

Everything remained almost exactly the same as the previous year except you have less mortgage interest (a good thing) which means you still take the standard deduction.

Very typical return for you - you owe a bit less than last year which is good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

P.S. The HRB tax return looks right - they increased the cost basis of the Vertex trades correctly. Your wages went up $71k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket.  You also had gains in your trades - all long term but still they added to your tax burden. MA is a bit lower but not much and is lower due to the undergraduate student loan interest deduction. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Congrats on the new job!  You owe a good amount due to a big increase in your wages due to a big increase in Vertex stock price making your restricted stock vesting much more valuable (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). You have long term capital gains on your trades after we adjusted the cost basis to make sure you weren't double taxed on your Vertex shares. 

You would have owed more but you got a $5k credit for excess Social Security withholdings due to switching jobs.  Finally, made sure to note that both of you made an extra $6.5k contribution to your IRAs and rolled them over to your Roth IRAs. Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

As previously discussed, a good amount of wages with stock vesting (as well as some gains on trades - nice!) has you owing a significant amount again this year. We will be filing the FBAR on your behalf. Everything else looks good - hope all is well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. As we discussed, a good amount of wages with stock vesting has you owing a significant amount again this year. Your wage income was up a lot again last year - nearly $40k. Unfortunately the withholdings again didn't keep up and you're owing a good bit again this year. I would suggest making $3,000 quarterly payments - would you like me to set them up so that they automatically come out of the bank account we have for you? This would have avoided the $484 penalty you got this year. Finally, we will be filing the FBAR on your behalf. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Second verse, almost the same as the first!  As we discussed, a good amount of wages with stock vesting has you owing a significant amount again this year. Your wage income was at the same level this year.. Unfortunately the withholdings again didn't keep up and you're owing a good bit again this year. Again I would suggest making $3,000 quarterly payments - would you like me to set them up so that they automatically come out of the bank account we have for you?

You owe a good bit due to your high wage income and gains on trades, but paying quarterlies automatically for next year should hopefully eliminate that problem next year (unless you have even more gains on trades!). Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a LOT less due to the quarterly payments (and no tax penalties this year!).  We were able to use the losses on your trades to offset gains on your other trades and then use the remainder of $3k to lower your taxable income (and we are tracking the rest to use in the future).
Your wages went up $143k and your withholdings mostly kept up with last year's level. We wrote off all your charity but had to limit your mortgage interest deduction due to the $750,000 mortgage limit cap. We agreed to make your automatic quarterlies at $22,500 per quarter as that served us well last year having quarterly payments.
Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023


Very similar to last year income wise - you actually have a refund this year due to the quarterly payments!  We were able to use the losses on your trades to offset gains on your other trades and then use the remainder of $2,938 to lower your taxable income.  Your wages went down $145k and your withholdings mostly kept up with last year's level. We wrote off all your charity but had to limit your mortgage interest deduction due to the $750,000 mortgage limit cap. We agreed to keep your automatic quarterlies at $22,500 per quarter as that served us well last year having quarterly payments. Finally, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $3,565 by filing jointly to owing a total of $21 when factoring in what each of you owe, thus saving $3,544 by doing this!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Income up over $100k last year! Made you head of household filing status which is more favorable than single and gave you a higher standard deduction of $19,400. You were above the $200k threshold to get the full $2,000 per child tax credit but still you got most of it. Everything else looked good and still getting a refund which is great.  Let me know if any questions - thanks and good luck in the new job!

Dialed back the work just a teensy bit but dialed back the quarterlies a bit too much! That said no big deal for a baller like you. Great dividends and capital gains. Nice SEP IRA deduction as well as deducted the health insurance and then the other usual culprits (mortgage, charity, etc.). Set up quarterlies for next year based on this year. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Business income up about $36k with a HUGE long term capital gain from Nuance - nice! Should have followed your lead. Nice SEP contribution and the health insurance were good deductions for you. You still owe a bit but nothing you can't handle baller. Set up quarterlies for you next year based on $200k. Let me know if any questions - thanks and hope to see you soon!

Even more dividends and interest plus some great gains on your trades (nearly all long term) has you owing a good amount again this year, but your tax payments covered nearly all of it. The reason why you owe in MA is because of the dividends and trades. Everything else looks good we noted Hardwin's non deductible IRA contribution. Hope all is well! Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. You owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. You have great dividends of $50k and some long term capital gains of $18k which is a good reason why you owe. We made sure to take the standard deduction to conform to the married filing separately rules (this only cost you $500). We made sure to properly increase the cost basis of your Vertex trades. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Again you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. You did a nice job with the quarterly payment!  You have great dividends of $59k and some long term capital gains of $67k which is a good reason why you owed again this year.

Rental is cashflowing nicely - the depreciation wipes out all taxable income from it save $151 but that is a non-cash expense so looks like a great investment! Please set up appointment with me so we can talk about your return and answer your questions for the upcoming year - thanks.

2022


P.S. You are getting a nice little refund - good job on the quarterlies! Your rental is cashflowing nicely over a full year now. We made sure to increase the FULL cost basis on your Vertex trades and deduct $3,000 of the loss against your regular income and carry the remaining loss forward to use in future years. Some great charity is a really nice deduction for you. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a little bit but not too much - your federal quarterly payment was almost spot on but you had increased investment income this year which made you owe more than we projected originally.  Your rental continues to cashflow nicely and is making money after depreciation is taken out. We made sure to increase the FULL cost basis on your Vertex trades but you still made $10k on the trades - we used the carryforward losses from last year to reduce it by $3k. Finally some great charity again was a really nice deduction for you with an EXTRA bonus this year - charity is now deductible in MA so you got an extra $5k back in MA due to the charity - nice! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Great year for you income wise! Unfortunately nowhere near enough was withheld for federal taxes and you owe a good amount. Let me know if any questions on anything thanks.

Very similar year for you as previous years - still the same level of wages, still good gains from trades, and still owing about the same amount. Looking forward to catching up in our zoom - talk soon.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $100k and your withholdings kept up. You had gains on your trades and we also reported the crypto trades. The new thing that we need to talk about is your ISO's - we'll talk in May about those. That said, you continue to owe a good amount every year and with interest rates going up the tax penalties for owing a lot come tax time have gotten much higher (it's $600 this year vs $100 in previous years). I'd recommend you pay quarterlies of $6,000 each - I can set these up to be paid automatically to the IRS from the bank account I have on file for you. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Similar to last year results wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $121k and your withholdings kept up with past year's levels.

ANDY PRINT THEIR 2020 RETURN AND SIGNATURES AND LINK TO THIS JOB (JUST LIKE A KIDS RETURN BASICALLY) CALL ME IF QUESTIONS Amended your 2020 tax return to get you almost $20k back! The MA refund for 2020 will be direct deposited but the federal refund for 2020 will be sent via check (no direct deposit option for amended federal). We corrected the cost basis of that one trade to have it show $4k in gains instead of the $92k it was showing. For 2021 nothing really changed EXCEPT we were able to preserve $50k of your carryforward loss from 2020 to use going forward so that's good - in case you have any big gains going forward we can use this to offset them. We were able to do this by amending the 2020 return. Please let me know if any questions - pleasure talking with you today.

2022

p.s. Your wage income continues to climb (up over $1MM thanks to Vertex stock vesting!) BUT you owe only a little bit compared to your income thanks to the automatic quarterlies. Glad we decided on the $30k quarterlies it really helped - I upped them to $35k as that should put you in good stead for next year. We got you a $1,000 tax credit for the charger install. You had slight gains in your trades and we used the loss carryforward from last year to the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We obviously took the mortgage interest and itemized to get you the best possible deduction there. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Your wage income continues to climb yet again (up over $1.2MM thanks to Vertex stock vesting at increased stock price!) BUT you owe only a little bit compared to your income thanks to the automatic quarterlies. Glad we decided on the $35k quarterlies it really helped - I upped them to $40k as that should put you in good stead for next year. We also started MA quarterlies of $5.5k each due to MA millionaire's tax kicking in.  We got you a $337 tax credit for the doors and windows - better than nothing!

Another good year for you income wise! E-quarterlies set up for you - hope all is well!

2022

"	p.s.  Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $190k and your withholdings kept up. We reported your Vertex trades and made sure to increase the cost basis so that you weren't double taxed. We were able to write off $3k of the trade losses against your regular income and will carry forward the rest. We also deducted your mortgage interest for both properties to the extent we could and your Vertex share donation.  
Right now you owe $18,529 to the federal government and getting a $670 refund from MA. The quarterlies we had you pay automatically helped you avoid paying penalties and reduced the amount you currently owe. Implemented automatic quarterlies of $10,000 considering this current tax situation per discussion via email with you.
Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

"	Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but hardly anything thanks to our quarterlies which were spot on!

Congrats again on getting married!  It threw off your direct Roth contribution but we can backdoor the contributon so you end up in the same place.

Slight losses in your trades last year when adjusted for proper cost basis so that you aren't double taxed.  This isn't necessarily the best news but it means you are getting a refund this year. Everything else looks good we wrote off the trading losses of $2,233 against regular income and are deducting your mortgage interest and charity. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income, although you did swing from a refund to owing. Your wages went up $67k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 35%. The new thing that helped you out this year is a full year's worth of mortgage interest which is a nice deduction for you. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar yet again to last year income and results wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $29k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket. We made sure to get your mortgage interest in there which saved you $4k in taxes.  Finally happy to hear you will max out the ESPP in the upcoming period please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions on it.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and thanks again for all the referrals!

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $68k and your withholdings mostly kept up. You had some gains on your trades - all short term and we made sure to increase the cost basis on the Vertex trades so you weren't double taxed. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Again very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $61k and your withholdings mostly kept up at the same level. You had some gains on your trades - $14k of it was short term and we made sure to increase the cost basis on the Adobe and Vertex trades so you weren't double taxed. The remaining $4k was long term and taxed at the most favorable tax rates.  Everything else looked good. Finally I just wanted to let you know that our new client minimum is $850 and that will be your rate next year as long as everything remains similar to this year (we will keep it the same this year in light of our longstanding relationship).  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Very similar to last year - you owe a good amount amount but very similar to last year.  Your wages went up a good amount and your withholdings kept up relative to last year but you still owe a good amount.  I would recommend $5,000 quarterly tax payments - I have included them with the return but let me know if you want me to set them up automatically and I can do that with my software.  Finally made sure to make a Schedule C to report the Bluebird income and with expenses were able to reduce that to zero.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $277k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $15k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. We included your excess 401k contribution as income this year so we won't have to amend this return next year when we get the withdrawal form back. And of course deducted all mortgage interest and charity. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges - all good!  Your wages went up almost $1.443MM(!) and your withholdings didn't keep up (how could they!).  This however made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  The good news is the automatic quarterlies made it so that you don't owe any penalty interest.  For the takeover of Chinook there were some difficulties figuring out if the list of stock compensation was reported as trades but after talking to Susan's colleague we figured out that these were unvested and thus wouldn't be reported as a taxable transaction anywhere - just as wages.

We also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $50,190 by filing jointly to owing a total of $$33,259, thus saving $16,931 by doing this!

We discussed quarterlies and decided to do $20,000 per quarter.

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and hope all is well!

p.s. As we discussed, your wage income was up a lot last year - nearly $329k. Unfortunately the withholdings didn't keep up and you're owing a good bit more than last year. We made sure to properly increase the cost basis on your Vertex trades. We made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity which was a nice deduction for you. We reported all possible expenses for your rentals and will be preserving the losses for future years (as well as amending 2021 to allocate mortgage interest properly). Everything else looked good.

Your income went up a LOT last year! However you had good withholdings through your jobs and the $24,000 estimated payment was spot on nice job. I set quarterlies up for you to do based on last year if things continue in the same way. I also took into account your ISO exercise and booked "bargain element" income for that transaction - the good news is you were under the AMT tax there so no adverse tax consequences for that exercise. I will monitor the cost basis of that stock going forward. There were slight losses on your other trades but not that much and we deducted those losses. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. MONSTER refund this year! You had a big decrease in wages and your withholdings were good so you get a good portion of it back.  You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.Everything else looked good. Hope you are doing well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

You had a big increase in wages of $187k and your withholdings were good so you get a good nice refund.  Your dividend and interest income went up $8k compared to last year.

ANDY THERE IS A FILE IN THE DIRECTORY PLEASE SEND TO THEM IT'S A PAYMENT VOUCHER FOR INDIANA THEY DON'T ALLOW E-PAYMENT RIDICULOUS! You owe a good amount more this year vs. last year for the following reasons, I think: 1) Last year you would have owed around $8k I think but you switched jobs and got excess social security withheld of $8,100 back 2) You had business income from Wash Systems of about $28k - this added about $9k to your amount owed 3) I think the withholdings for your new jobs might be a bit lower than previous levels - previous years your withholdings were about $70k to $80k and this year your withholdings are $54k We can fix this by doing automatic quarterly payments in the future (assuming Wash Systems continues to make similar money). Just let me know and I can set that up - would suggest about $5,500 per quarter right now. We made sure to file in Indiana and get you credit for the taxed paid there on your MA tax return. Unfortunately Indiana doesn't allow electronic payment - we have included a payment voucher for them. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. GREAT refund this year! Your withholdings from your wages went up significantly - even without the $7k in excess social security you had returned to you you still would have had a $4k refund. So kudos to you for adjusting your withholdings right on target. You had business income from Wash Systems of about $25k - we made sure to file in Indiana and get you credit for the taxed paid there on your MA tax return. Unfortunately Indiana doesn't allow electronic payment - we have included a payment voucher for them. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

You owe a little bit but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $27k.  We deducted your mortgage interest and some nice charity for a great deduction. You had business income from Wash Systems of about $36k - we made sure to file in Indiana and get you credit for the taxed paid there on your MA tax return. Unfortunately Indiana doesn't allow electronic payment - we have included a payment voucher for them. Finally Justine had a nice first year in business and we made sure to record her solo 401k contribution for a nice deduction.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and congrats on a great year!

Nice wage income! We made sure your options trades were accounted for properly so you weren't double taxed. Good estimated payments and a refund of your excess social security withholdings meant you are getting a great refund for both fed and MA. We set you up to buy $5,000 of the I-bonds (thanks for teaching me something new!) and the rest will be direct deposited. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $128k and your withholdings kept up but no quarterly payments this year means you swing from a refund to owing a slight amount. The new thing this year that helped out is we itemized due to your charity. We made sure to make your backdoor Roth non-taxable and got you the excess social security that you put in while switching jobs. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well.

Very similar to last year except this year you have $30k in long term capital gains from sale of Biogen stock, which is why you owe a bit more both federally and in MA.

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.

Additionally you had good gains on your stock trades.  The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year.

All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages went up $123k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had some good gains on your stock trades - all taxed at the most favorable tax rates but still it added to your tax burden.

p.s. You owe a good amount again this year because you had $228k of options income and $44k of restricted stock income vesting to your W2. This was withheld at the standard 22% rate whereas you are squarely in the 32-35% tax bracket so this was underwithheld by a good amount.

This was withheld at the standard 22% rate whereas you are squarely in the 32-35% tax bracket so this was underwithheld by a good amount.  Nothing you can do about it - just letting you know why you owe.  Your wages were down compared to last year because of no options income.  Everything else looks good - let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks!

p.s. You owe a good amount yet again this year because you had $128k of restricted stock income vesting to Reena's W2 as well as an options exercise for $384k. This was withheld at the standard 22% rate whereas you are squarely in the 37% top tax bracket so this was underwithheld by a good amount. Again - nothing you can do about it - just letting you know why you owe. You had losses in your trades (after accounting for the true cost basis of the Vertex stock) which we deducted against your regular income. Finally got you back your excess social security contributions due to having had more than one job. Everything else looks good - let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks!

2023

Wages were down a lot but that leads to a great refund!  Nice withholdings on your W2 income. You had $8k in gains on your trades - mostly long term which is taxed at the most favorable rate.  Just so you know, both spouses need to have earned income to exclude the $5k in dependent care account so we had to make that taxable.  Everything else looks good - let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks!
Client 163 - Married Filling Jointly

Your wages were down and thus the amount of tax you owed last year went down, but with no quarterlies paid you owe a significant amount. That said you had no gains on your stock trades and we took $3,000 of your losses to offset other income, which helped a little bit. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Your wages were up 50% from last year but it's a very similar story to two years ago just that you have about $25k more in dividends. You had $21k in short term capital gains and $11k in long term capital gains - this is the main reason why you owed in MA. We made sure that your backdoor Roth conversions were not taxable. You might want to consider making quarterly payments - I would suggest somewhere in the $35k per quarter range and have sent these forms to you. I can set these up to come out of the bank account I have on file for you automatically. That said, you did a good job with the two $50k payments last year so it seems like you have a handle on this. Let me know if you want to hear more about that or have any questions - thanks and hope all is well.

2023

Your wages were up from last year but just slightly - it's a very similar story to last year just that you have about $60k more in dividends. You had $13k in short term capital gains and $14k in long term capital gains - this and the new MA millionaire's tax which we discussed is the main reason why you owed in MA. We made sure that your backdoor Roth conversions were not taxable. You made quarterly payments of three $50k payments last year which really helped out. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Nice increase in wage income due to income from options exercises. We adjusted the cost basis on your trades so that you weren't double taxed on those gains as they were already taxed as wage income. Still there were probably little to no withholdings on those options exercise and sell so that is why you owe a good amount this year. AMAZING exercise and hold of your other options - you were right at the threshold of getting AMT tax but you didn't get any so now you can hold on for long term capital gains with those options that you exercised and held. We reflected in the return your $6k non-deductible contribution to the IRA. All in all a great job by you last year - let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Nice refund - you really nailed it with that estimated payment! The refund is not too much considering your overall income but could swing towards owing depending on restricted stock vesting so we'll keep an eye on it. $1,525 of the refund was due to excess social security contributions due to switching jobs being returned. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We also made sure to have you take out excess Roth 401k contributions. We properly excluded your backdoor Roth rollover from taxation. Everything else looked good. We discussed it and you don't want to to do automatic quarterlies of $4,000 per quarter federal and $625 MA as there won't be much stock vesting this year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Wages up! Interest up! Contributions to dependent care account up FINALLY! Got half the credit for Hope upfront and yet you still have a bigger refund than previous years! That's how Green Oak does it! Talk tomorrow....

2022

p.s. You weren't kidding - nothing much has changed except refund was up! Good job on everything the only quibbles I have are Jess didn't max out her retirement contributions and you didn't spend all your money on childcare (set aside $5k but didn't spend $745 of it). Everything else looked good. See you on zoom!

You weren't kidding - nothing much has changed except refund was down!  Good job on everything the only quibbles I had from last year (Jess didn't max out her retirement contributions and you didn't spend all your money on childcare (set aside $5k but didn't spend $745 of it)) are gone!  A perfect return!  Your refund being down - not really sure why that happened to be honest.  By the way MA has a charity deduction now so you got a $812 MA deduction for that. Everything else looked good. See you on zoom…………….IF YOU DARE!

Wage income is down but business income is way up! Congrats on starting fully in your own business. You owe a good bit but you brought that down with your quarterlies and by maximizing your SEP. You're set up for automatic quarterlies for next year - just please make sure to put the SEP IRA contribution in by April 15. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022


p.s. Business income is WAY up! Great job with the quarterlies and the extra payments - kept the amount you owe down and prevented tax penalties. Please maximize your SEP by April 18th to $61,000 for the 2022 tax year. You're set up for automatic quarterlies for next year - just please make sure to put the extra $3,000 SEP IRA contribution in by April 18. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Business income came in a bit higher than we projected last year and thus you owe.  Great job with the quarterlies - kept the amount you owe down and prevented tax penalties. Please make your SEP contribution by April 15th in the amount of $41,775 for the 2023 tax year. You're set up for automatic quarterlies for next year for both federal and MA.

Nice refund in NJ welcome to Jersey! You still owe the federal government most likely due to the big increase in income. MA is breakeven as usual. Let me know if any questions - hope you are enjoying it down there.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $91k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had a rental in NJ which made a little bit of money. That said, the refund from NJ more than offset what you owe to the feds to make you get an overall refund. We set up your rental for the years to come. Additionally filed you properly in MA and NJ. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Refunds across the board nice!  Your wages went up $52,500 and your withholdings kept up. Your mortgage interest and charity were a great deduction and we took full advantage.  Your rental in NJ had a loss but only after depreciation expenses - you are cashflowing positively which is great! Speaking of NJ we filed you properly in MA and NJ to reflect the small amount of wages you had there. Thanks again for the referral to Katherine I appreciate it!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

We adjusted your taxable income this year for the excess 401k contributions so we don't have to amend next year. Lots of trades but ended up in a $6k loss, of which we used $3k as a tax deduction (that's the maximum we carried forward the rest for next year). This year was very similar to 2019 otherwise. Congrats again on the new job hope all is well!

2022

No Vertex means no more of that vesting stock and therefore you actually get a refund this year as the withholdings are correct! We continued to use $3k as a tax deduction for the trade losses last year (that's the maximum we carried forward the rest for next year) as well as deduct your mortgage interest and charity. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope you're doing well!

2023

You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. You had losses on your trades after adjusting the cost basis to be correct on your CRSP stock trades.

2021

Very similar to last year but less wages and more losses on trades we were able to write off against regular income and more mortgage interest led to you owing a bit less this year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022


p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $175k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $9,000 for federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. We accounted for the sale of your rental in MD - there was a gain on the sale but we were able to use the passive losses to reduce your taxes substantially (and even to zero in MD). Not only that we put in the amount withheld in MD at the house closing so that you get all of that back! Finally made sure both you and Alison itemized as that was the best overall result for your family. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount AGAIN - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $185k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $21,000 for federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Finally made sure both you and Alison itemized as that was the best overall result for your family. Congrats again on the move to Philadelphia!  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Less Schedule C business income and more withholdings (perhaps due to the change in jobs) leads to a HUGE refund! Also got back excess social security due to the 2 jobs. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Big increase in your business income led to you owing this year. That said we took every deduction possible and also made sure to maximize your SEP IRA to reduce your tax burden as much as possible.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $10k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a lot less (as predicted!) was that you had a full year's worth of mortgage interest - a great deduction for you!Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Similar to last year income wise BUt you owe because even though your wages went up only $8k your withholdings went down about $5k.  You might want to look into that at your jobs to see if something changed with your withholdings.  You were still good in that you don't owe any penalty interest.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Big increase in your rental real estate taxes meant your rental swung from a profit to a loss (on paper, at least) - I'm guessing you lost the residential exemption for it. More wage income and more gains on our trades led to you owing a bit more this year. Let me know if any questions thanks.

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $52k and your withholdings kept up. We increased the cost basis on your Blueprint trade so you weren't double taxed on it. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. The rental is still doing great although big repairs this year made it into a bigger loss for it this year. Everything else looked good almost the perfect return! (in tax world that's where you neither owe nor get a refund). Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a bit but not too much given your overall income.  Your wages went up $33k and your withholdings kept up. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. In particular we made sure to book the crypto losses.  The rental is doing great and almost making a profit even after depreciation nice! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Your return is very similar to last year except for the fact that you got half of your child tax credit of $2,000 upfront last year so you are only getting $2k in child tax credit this year (instead of $4k last year) through your tax return. Hence the reason you owe an extra $2k this year vs. last year. We continue to spread your IRA distribution from 2020 over 3 years so $6,678 of that is taxable this year. Please let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks.

2022

p.s. Your return is AGAIN very similar to last year except for the fact that you got $500 tax credit for energy improvements due to your home renovation. Hence the reason you owe a little less this year vs. last year. We continued to spread your IRA distribution from 2020 over 3 years so $6,678 of that is taxable this year BUT this is the last year for that! So next year your amount owed should go down by about $1,800. Please let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks.

2023

No more need to spread your IRA distribution from 2020 over 3 years so $6,678 is NO LONGER taxable!  However to offset that you lose $1,100 of child tax credits because Luca went over the age to qualify for the full $2,000 tax credit.  Anyways the net effect was to leave you in roughly the same place.  Please let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks.

p.s. Your overall wages went up $56k (probably partly due to Bonnie's new job - congrats!) and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had gains in your trades (all long term - the best kind) even after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock - without the trades you would have only owed $4k to federal and $300 to MA. Still it's a good thing! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

p.s. Very similar to two years ago income wise due to no Translate Bio options exercises - you are once again getting a refund! We made sure to report all your trades including the crypto trades. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Unfortunately you didn't qualify for the EV tax credit. Still continuing to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Coming back to some normalcy as far as what you owe!  I like the sell immediately and derisking from Spotify strategy.

Wages more than doubled last year!  In addition you now have enough mortgage interest to itemize so we are no longer taking the standard deduction.  We got you the excess social security withheld of $3,705 due to Phil's switching jobs.  You would have owed slightly without that credit but still wouldn't have been that much.  Finally made sure to bump up the cost basis of the trade of AMYT to reflect sell to cover. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022


p.s. Wages down about $52k last year and without the excess social security from switching jobs you actually owe a tiny amount. In addition your mortgage interest charity and taxes paid (capped at $10k) is below the standard deduction of $25,900 so we are no longer itemizing. Everything else looked good. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

A big jump in wages (about $200k) and your withholdings went up as well but not as much led to you owing about $10k this year. We got your $3,200 in energy credits as well as $600 for your car charger.  Next year we will get you that MA Septic Credit!  Everything else looks good - in right under the wire! Hope all is well - let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

You owe this year as opposed to previous year where you would have gotten a slight refund if you didn't change jobs. Not sure what happened to your withholdings but let's do a zoom to discuss - I'm thinking you should do automatic quarterlies through my software but we can discuss.

2022

p.s. Similar to last year wage income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $33k and your withholdings kept up but not as much as we would have liked. Your dividends and interest went up $3k. The new thing that made you owe a good bit more was a BIG gain on your Etrade trades (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. Without those trades you would have owed $10k (vs. the $17k you owe all in right now).  Finally a new thing you might want to consider this year is making quarterly payment of $2,500 - I provided the forms in case you want to do that. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe but thanks to the quarterlies you don't owe any interest. Your wages went up $59k and your withholdings kept up but not as much as we would have liked. Most likely this is due to bonus income which can be withheld at a lower rate than your regular paycheck.  Your dividends and interest went up a big $10k.  I have recommended making quarterly payments of $4,000 to account for increased dividends and interest and potential underwitholding on bonus payments - I set those up to come out automatically as per your instruction. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to TWO years ago income wise - nice refund getting nearly all of your quarterly payments back! You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Now that you have mortgage interest we can deduct it along with your charity to give you an even better result! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Very similar to last year - nice refunds once again!  Your wages went down $22k but your withholdings kept up.  In MA you got the Septic Credit of $1,500 again - please remember this is the last year you will get it so next year your MA return will be smaller by that amount.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Your wages went up $57k and your withholdings kept up but not as much as previous years. Thus you have a refund but it's smaller than previous years. That said, it's a refund! In MA no more Septic Credit of $1,500 so your MA refund is back to normal. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a bit due to a BIG gain on your Vertex share sales (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).

Good job with your quarterly payments they took what could have been owing a lot to something manageable! Lots of Vertex trades but we made sure to adjust the basis so that you weren't double taxed on it. We also set up your rental property - looks like it's cashflowing nicely but because of deductions and depreciation it's showing a loss. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $321k (due to no more Vertex stock vesting) but your withholdings were spot on - nice slight refund which is where you want to be! The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that we removed Brendon as a dependent and switched your filing status to single. Finally a new thing this year is we added a new rental which has a loss (as most rentals do in the beginning) but this was good as it offset the BIG income you are getting from your first rental! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went up $37k and your withholdings kept up but you had more income from other sources such as trades and investment income.  In addition because you have more than $150 in income you no longer get to deduct some of your rental loss. We continue to deduct your alimony which was good for you.   And of course we deducted your mortgage interest everywhere we could a nice deduction for you.  Finally the new rental has a loss (as most rentals do in the beginning) but this was good as it again offset the income you are getting from your first rental! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Client 190

2021

You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE $108k gain on your Relay shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. You additionally had another $26k added to your tax bill due to AMT tax on the "bargain element" income of $131k you have to recognize for AMT tax purposes on the ISO options you exercised and held. We will file to preserve this amount as a AMT tax credit which we will be able to utilize when AMT taxable income is lower than regular tax income (which should hopefully happen when you sell these shares). We are tracking the AMT cost basis of these shares so if you eventually sell them we can adjust the cost basis and realize the aforementioned tax credit. Finally, with respect to the AMT, we itemized instead of taking the higher standard deduction because it lowered your AMT income and thus lowered your overall taxes. Additionally, we made sure to note your $6k contribution to your IRA. All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. You are getting a federal refund thanks to utilizing $15k of the AMT tax credits on your Relay ISO shares by bumping up the AMT cost basis for those sales (a good thing and shows that your ISO exercise really worked out great). The remainder $7k in AMT tax credits is being preserved to hopefully use again when you sell the remaining ISO shares that you exercised in 2021. We excluded the QSBS eligible trade to give you some great tax savings there on $13k of gains (and will amend 2021 come May) in both federal and MA returns. Everything else looked good - congrats again on the upcoming wedding!

Wages are up big thanks to the addition of Tyler to the family.  You are getting a federal refund thanks to excluding the QSBS eligible trades to give you some great tax savings there on about $30k of gains in both federal and MA returns.  We also reported the ISO exercises properly and reported bargain element income for the small amount of ISO's that you held (it didn't cause any AMT).  Finally we got almost all the remainder $7k in AMT tax credits to come through this year!  $653 is being preserved to hopefully use again when you sell the remaining ISO shares that you exercised but the rest of the credits came through giving you a nice refund!  Everything else looked good - have fun on your trip!

Congrats on the new house! You owe a bit more this year due to good capital gains. Let me know if any questions thanks.

2022


p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $57k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit less was less gains on your trades. We accounted for that pesky Computershare trade (phew!) and that was a loss but you had other gains that overcame that (a good thing!). They were all long term the best kind of tax treatment. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went down a good amount - and thus you are getting a GREAT refund!  Your wages went down $146k and your withholdings kept up - this is most likely due to no longer having the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%.  The good news is that you are getting all of these quarterly payments back! I have recommended lower quarterlies for the upcoming year of $1k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You owe a good bit less than previous years but still owe a good amount. I included quarterlies in case you want to consider doing them. I can even set them up to be done automatically through my software - just let me know if you'd like me to do that. We realized prior suspended losses on the K1 from Enterprise Products because you completely sold that off. No real trading gains to speak of.

You had nice dividend and interest income and some gains in your trades (only $2k of which was short term). The new thing this year is your mortgage interest paid went down enough (a good thing means you are paying off that loan) that you no longer itemize as the standard deduction is higher. Finally little Rose got you an extra $1700 due to the child tax credit congrats again! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You owe a good bit more than previous years as your wages climbed back past $500k and your withholdings didn't keep up. I included quarterlies in case you want to consider doing them. I can even set them up to be done automatically through my software - just let me know if you'd like me to do that. Additionally you had lots of income that had no withholdings that helped contribute to what you owe.  $45k in dividends and interest!  $11k from Lincoln! $39k in gains from trades!  Anyways it all added up.  Got you the excess social security of $10k back due to switching jobs. Everything else looked good. Hope all is well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

ANDY JUST RETURNS AND SIGNATURES THANKS It makes more sense for you to claim Anna on your return as Jeff makes too much money to get the child tax credit of $2,000. Thus Anna swung you from owing to a slight refund! Everything else was similar to last year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $14k but your withholdings kept up. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. You continue to claim Anna so we can exclude the $5k dependent care expenses as well as get the $2k child tax credit. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went up $14k and your withholdings more than kept up. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. You continue to claim Anna so we can exclude the $5k dependent care expenses as well as get the $2k child tax credit. No $12k in other income from Lincoln means you get a great refund compared to last year.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Things are very similar to last year but the $14k in IRA contributions gives you a nice refund! I took down your quarterlies to $1,000 this year to reflect that. Your business is still making some good money. All looks good - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar again to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much. Your wages went up $9k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a little less was that Patsy had a small loss in her business (which we were able to deduct). We also deducted the $14k in IRA contributions just like last year. No quarterly payments mean you owe a little this year but not a big deal. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar again to last year income wise EXCEPT this year your business had more revenues but much more expenses and so you had a big loss.  This loss offset your other income and now you are due a good refund!  Your wages went down $1k and your withholdings kept up. We also deducted the $15k in IRA contributions just like last year. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 196 - Married Filling Jointly

2021
Your wage income grew nicely due to Vickie going full time W2. Of course, due to that Vickie's business income decreased quite a bit. The rental property is really cashflowing nicely you raised the rents and now making a great profit! We used depreciation and prior year losses to offset that income and make it zero. We set quarterlies based on last year's experience as well as your estimate of upcoming business income. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Your wage income remained EXACTLY THE SAME (only $44 difference which is the closest I've ever seen!). Vickie's business income increased by $4k. The rental property is really cashflowing nicely you raised the rents yet again and now making an even better profit! We used depreciation and prior year losses to offset that income but it wasn't enough to make it zero so there is taxable rental income on your return this year. We no longer need quarterlies due to retirement but this past year was a perfect estimate - great job! Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope you are enjoying retirement!

2023 

Your wage income went down a lot which makes sense as Ted retired. We removed Vickie's business from the return.  The rental property continues to cashflow nicely you made a little less due to increased expenses but still had a good profit.  We no longer need quarterlies due to retirement but I would recommend having $4k come out of Ted's pension on the federal side to make sure to cover your federal tax obligation.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope you are enjoying retirement!
Client 197 - Married Filling Jointly

2021
Big income year for you. You owe a bit but not too much - nice job on the estimated payments.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $71k and your withholdings kept up. However, no quarterly payments has you owing $44k to the feds. My software calculated $2k in tax penalties for you but I removed them from the return as sometimes their calculation is high - that said you should be prepared if the IRS sends you a letter asking for some interest. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.
The new thing this year was a move to NH (Milton is sad to see you go!). We reported your home sale and excluded all gain - a nice $495k tax break for you! We also allocated interest and dividends properly between the two states. Finally, we have to file the MA tax return via paper as I had to override Mike's W2 in order to get you the MA refund you deserve (it's a little more than $12.5k). This should work but please make sure to include a paper copy of the documentation sheet and Mike's W2 with the filing and send it via registered mail, return receipt requested (and don't forget to both sign it as well!). Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year results wise in both federal and MA - you owe a bit federally but not too much considering your overall income and in MA you are getting another MASSIVE refund to basically offset what you owe to the feds. Your wages went up $225k and your withholdings, combined with the quarterlies, kept up.  My software calculated $0 in tax penalties for you - nice! You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  We also reported your HSA contribution of $5k which was a nice deduction for you!  The new thing this year was Ashley's CBD business - it has a loss but that's normal in the first year - we made sure to deduct it.  Finally, we have to file the MA tax return via paper AGAIN (I don't know maybe you hand deliver it this time to make sure they get it?) as I had to override Mike's W2 in order to get you the MA refund you deserve (it's a little more than $31k). This WILL work but please make sure to include a paper copy of the documentation sheet and Mike's W2 with the filing and send it via registered mail, return receipt requested (and don't forget to both sign it as well!). Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Wages went up significantly. Also your mortgage interest went down a good deal due to the refinance (a good thing) but now you don't have as big of a deduction and that is why you owe this year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Wages went down by $37k but you had unemployment income which kept your overall income up. Good thing we reported that Fidelity as there were losses in there - we used $3k of it (the maximum possible) to reduce your tax burden. Claiming 3 dependents also helped you get a child tax credit of $6k and swing you to a healthy refund. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Wages went up significantly by almost $50k.  Also your mortgage interest went up a good as well so now you have a big deduction and that is helping you out a lot.  Finally you got just a little over $3k in energy tax credits this year nice! Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

BIG refund this year as you got $3,600 child tax credit (even after getting a lot of it upfront) as well as dependent care credit of $8,000!  The child tax credit next year is back to $2k per child but still you took full advantage this year!	Wages are up and Lizzie's business is back!  Quarterly payments were good keep that up for next year now that your business is back on track.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT Lizzie's business income went up a good amount - you are getting a refund though thanks to good quarterlies! Lizzie's business income went up $18k and she can put a maximum of $8,638 towards her SEP IRA. Also noted the $6k Roth contribution. Everything else looks good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT increased investment income of $6k and only one quarterly payment has you owing a bit.  Still the penalty interest calculated was small - only $34!  Lizzie's business income stayed right on track with last year - basically the same.  Also noted your respective $6.5k Roth contributions.   Gave you quarterlies for next year.  Finally maxed our your SEP IRA for some really great retirement savings as well as a nice deduction!  Everything else looks good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.  
Client 200

2021

It makes more sense for Juliato claim Anna on your return as you make too much money to get the child tax credit of $2,000. You had $100k in long term capital gains last year - we used the capital loss carryforward of $23k from last year to reduce that taxable amount but you were still taxed on $77k worth of gains and this is the reason why you owe this year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - EXCEPT now since you don't have a lot of capital gains you are getting a great refund! Your wages went up $19k and your withholdings kept up. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. 
The new thing this year was a full year rental - cashflowing positively but negative after depreciation - we will preserve those losses to use as appropriate in the future. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year - another great refund! Your wages went up $12k and your withholdings kept up. You had gains in your trades and we used the loss carryforward from last year to wipe them out and then deducted the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. The rental is cashflowing nicely almost breakeven even after depreciation! We will preserve those losses to use as appropriate in the future. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 201 - Married Filling Jointly

2021
Lot more wages this year - most likely due to the Alexion takeover and stock vesting. I used the proper cost basis for all your trades so that you weren't double taxed. Even though you didn't make quarterly payments you weren't hit with an underpayment penalty so not a big deal. I set you up with $3,000 per quarter payments based on this year's experience. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Even more wages this year! You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income - nice job on the estimated payments! Your wages went up $121k and your withholdings generally kept up. We made sure to exclude Monica's Roth conversion from taxation. We bumped up the cost basis for the AZN stock trades to reflect the true cost basis (which wasn't reported by Computershare). Of course we deducted your mortgage interest and charity. Finally a new thing this year is we provided you quarterly payment vouchers for the upcoming year which should stand you in good stead if this year repeats. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

You are getting a GREAT refund this year due to having more than one job and getting excess social security withheld of almost $10k back!  Still nice job on the estimated payments without the social security you would have gotten a $3k refund - therefore I am keeping your quarterlies at $2,500 this year. Your wages went down $109k and your withholdings generally kept up. We made sure to exclude Monica's Roth conversion from taxation. We again bumped up the cost basis for the AZN stock trades to reflect the true cost basis. And again we deducted your mortgage interest and charity -  a nice deduction for you. Finally we made sure to get you the child care dependent credit of $600 for all your daycare and camp spending. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well! 
Client 202 - Married Filling Jointly

2021

Very similar to last year results wise - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $128k and your withholdings kept up. We made sure to make your Roth IRA non-taxable as you had basis in it from prior contributions. We made sure to preserve the rental loss you had from last year ($64k) as a passive loss which we will be able to use in future years against rental income. The rental property continues to show a loss after depreciation which is normal and we are preserving those losses for the future as well. You had great gains on your trades - we made sure to adjust the basis on your work trades so that you didn't get double taxed on those trades. All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $78k and your withholdings kept up to leave you with a slight refund, especially when considering the gains you had on your trades ($47k - all long term). We also reported the bargain element on your options exercise but it wasn't enough to swing you into Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) which is great. The new thing this year was adding a second rental - both of them are cashflowing very nicely - making slight losses tax wise but cashflow wise after taking out the depreciation they are making good money. Finally got to deduct mortgage interest and itemize this year for an extra $6k deduction vs. the standard deduction. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Similar to two years ago results wise - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $70k to be at the level you were at in 2021 and your withholdings kept up for the most part.  Both of your rentals are cashflowing well and making profits before depreciation but Homer in particular is doing great - making a profit even after depreciation which is rare!  We made sure to use the rental loss you had from Moreland against that rental income to ensure you weren't taxed on the earnings from Homer. You had losses on your trades after we made sure to adjust the basis on your work trades so that you didn't get double taxed on those trades - we used the maximum loss of $3,000 against regular income and carried forward the rest to use in future years. All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks and congrats again on becoming citizens!

p.s. Very similar to last year income and results wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $54k and your withholdings kept up. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! And we will take the solar credit next year. Everything else looked good.

The remaining gain after that of $260k is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. We reported your business income and took all available deductions. Finally reported your income properly in both Illinois and MA and prepared tax returns for both states. Congrats on the move and hope you're enjoying Illinois.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2021

You don't owe so much due to a significant decrease in wages.  That's not necessarily a good thing but it is now!  The Vertex trades added to that income but all long term (and you did have some other investment income).  Reflected the new K1 in your return.  Rental cashflowing great but showed a slight loss due to lots of repairs.  Jimmy's business is doing even better - make sure to fund your SEP IRA amount of $2,894 by April 18th.  Finally, no more paying back that $7,500 first time homebuyers loan you got back in 2009!  All in all, a great result for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!


2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $231k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due. We got Jimmy's business income to be almost zero with all the deductions as well as depreciating the tools he got last year. Additionally, the rental is cashflowing so nicely - no repairs meant you made about $12k taxable income from it even when factoring in the $6,000 depreciation expense! The trades brought you about $40k of gains - all long term but still it added to your tax burden. Finally we discussed and agreed it's a good idea to do $9,500 quarterlies especially in light of Liz's promotion so that's what we've set up for you. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

You owed about $68k to fed and $7k to MA due to lots of investment and business income (almost $100k) combined with big wages of $1MM from Liz mostly due to stock vests withholding at 22% led to owing this amount.  That said, the quarterly payments you previously made mean you don't owe interest.  We agreed to up your quarterly payments this year to $15k per quarter and deal with the rest next April. Everything else looked good and very similar to previous years.  Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks and hope you're doing well! 
Client 206 - Married Filling Jointly

2021
Very similar to previous years but more tax owed due to increased business income was offset by excess social security credit of $4k you got back due to multiple W2s. I set you up with quarterlies you might want to consider doing that - if you want I can set that up to happen automatically on your behalf through the bank account I have on file for you - if so just let me know before you sign your tax return. Let me know if any questions - pleasure as always.

2022

p.s. NOT similar to last year income wise - you owe a good amount but still not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $235k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had $78k worth of gains on your trades and $19k of that was short term which is taxed at your marginal federal rate and at 12% in MA (vs the regular 5%). Finally the sneaker business made a little bit more this year nice! We discussed quarterlies but you decided not to do it. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Similar to last year income wise - you owe a good amount but still not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $26k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. You had $12k worth of gains on your trades and it was all taxed at long term capital gains tax rates which is taxed at 18.8% federal and 5% in MA - nice!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $87k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracketThe good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year AND you owe so much less than you normally would have! I have recommended and set up higher automatic quarterlies for the upcoming year of $5,000 for federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Finally We made sure to account for your $6k IRA contribution as well as the tax free rollover to a Roth. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Finally - a REFUND! Great job with the quarterlies - I dialed them back to $7k per quarter based on last year's results so that should keep you in good standing I believe. More wages last year and less mortgage interest due to the refinance (nice job) meant that you are doing everything right. Looks great. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022


p.s. Very similar to last year income wise and refund wise! Your wages went down $38k and your withholdings kept up. I have recommended the same quarterlies for the upcoming year of $2k federal based on this experience but also on your retention bonuses (nice!)- this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

You owe a good amount and it is most likely due to the retention bonus as we compared your withholdings from 2022 to 2023 and your withholdings as a % went down even though your wages went up.  Your wages went up $178k and your withholdings didn't keep up as much as you like. I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $4k federal based on this experience but also on your retention bonuses (nice!)- this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Finally we added a K1 for your business this year and made sure to deduct the loss against regular income to reduce your taxes a bit. Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

All in all, a great result for you - please sign asap if you are good with the return as we are up against the deadline - thanks!

p.s. Big change for you this year as you went to work full time for CSpace. Your withholdings on your job were good. We added the new business - it had a $12k loss which helped offset the $24k in gains from your trades. Please make sure to file your Form 5500-SF which is a yearly requirement and we agreed upfront that my firm was not and will not be taking care of as we don't file those forms.  All in all, a great result for you - great finally meeting you in person!

2023

You owe a good bit due to having some good income from wages, retirement distributions, social security and unemployment and not that much withholdings.  We also had to remove Stellar Research as a deduction from your return as it had zero revenue.  We reported every deduction possible for Mah-John sales.   Please make sure to file your Form 5500-SF which is a yearly requirement and we agreed upfront that my firm was not and will not be taking care of as we don't file those forms.

Nice refund even bigger than last year due to bigger tax credit for dependent care expenses. Hope all is well!

p.s. Very similar to last year - and same great refund! Your wages went up $14k and your withholdings kept up. We continue to get the child tax credit and dependent care expense credit. The new thing that made you owe a little bit more was that we created a rental schedule for you for your rental in France and reported the income you made there - there's not much after all the expenses (including depreciation) but still it's good to be making money. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Matt's business income went down $120k but a lot of that was due to hiring Rudi! We are contributing $40k to Matt's SEP IRA and then $20k to Rudi's solo 401k for a total of $60k - a nice deduction that really saves you on taxes! We are continuing with quarterlies but reducing them to $9k and $3k respectively - these will be coming directly out of your bank account on the appropriate dates. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and glad to get a great result!

Your income went up SUBSTANTIALLY last year (a good thing) but the withholdings for each of your jobs averaged around 25% but the average tax you got hit with was about 31.5% (and thus the reason you owe a good amount this year). You had some nice gains on your trades this year but we got to use $52k of your capital loss carryforward from previous years to offset those gains. Finally, for the ISO exercises nice job - I put them in the return but they didn't create any AMT. I'll track the cost basis of those shares going forward for you.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up another $500k! You owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $264k and your withholdings didn't really keep up - this is most likely due to the increased wage compensation and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid more than 110% of previous years taxes owed throughout the year through your jobs. That said, I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $30k federal to try to get ahead of this - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. You agreed to $20k which "at least is something" as you said! Your rental income went up nicely last year - continuing to make money after depreciation. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your wages went down almost $436k and your withholdings, combined with the automatic quarterlies, kept up to get you a slight refund - nice!  However being over $1MM in wages made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  You had healthy interest and dividends that increased $10k year over year. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the company stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  

We continue to report your rental in CA which had less revenue but also less expense so basically stayed with the same result.  We set you up with quarterlies for both federal based on this year's experience and MA to account for the new MA millionaire's tax.

Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $14,385 by filing jointly to owing a total of $1,451 between both of you, thus saving $12,934 by doing this!

On the federal signature pages there is a "Transaction Summary" that shows all payments and refunds where you initial to confirm your bank account. Please IGNORE what it says for MA state as far as what you owe there. This is what you would have owed if we filed jointly. I include this Summary because I think it's important for you to see all your refunds and payments in one place but rest assured the MA numbers are the ones on the signature pages you each sign separately

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and hope all is well!

Your wages are up about $85k compared to last year.  Unfortunately your withholdings didn't keep up with that increase and thus you owe more than last year.  Everything else remained the same (relatively speaking).  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. A massive increase in your income due to options exercises but your quarterly payments kept the amount you owe in reasonable territory (and you would have gotten a slight refund if you made that first quarterly payment!). Your wages went up $1.6MM and your withholdings didn't keep up (thus the need for the quarterlies). You had gains in your trades even after bumping up the cost basis for the Sprinklr stock to make sure you weren't double taxed on income reported as wages on your W-2. I've kept the upcoming quarterly payments in the same region in case this year repeats, but let me know if income is coming down and we can change. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Another BIG increase in your income due to restricted stock and options exercises but your quarterly payments and thus you owe a good amount. Your wages went up $682k and your withholdings didn't keep up (thus the need for the quarterlies next year). You had gains in your trades even after bumping up the cost basis for the Sprinklr stock to make sure you weren't double taxed on income reported as wages on your W-2. PDW with you, we've made the upcoming quarterly payments to be $46,250 fed and $11,250 MA as per our projection - this will stand you in good stead next year! We deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you!  Finally we made sure to file you as Head of Household to ensure you got the benefit of better tax brackets.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Wages are down slightly but with that your taxes owed are down slightly as well. Nice job with the quarterly payment it made the amount you owed at the end of the year relatively minimal. We made sure to increase the basis of your Vertex stock trades so that you weren't double taxed on them. Finally made sure to report your nanny properly. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Very similar to two years ago results wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $71k and your withholdings kept up. Nice job again with the end of year quarterly payment it helped reduce the damage. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. This year it's better to take the standard deduction as it's higher than your mortgage interest and charity and taxes paid (capped at $10k). Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Nice refund! We allocated your real estate taxes and mortgage interest pro rata as an expense towards your rental property revenue, and we are also depreciating the cost of your original purchase price of the home on the Schedule E rental property as well.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $88k but your withholdings still kept up when considering all your itemized deductions (especially your charity - nice job!). We taxed your NIH grant income properly.  The new thing this year was a full year of rental property so we made sure to take every deduction we could - there was a paper "passive loss" that we will preserve and use in the future as necessary. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and congrats again on Luisa!

Wages were down but the refund is up - nice refund!  Your wages went down $100k but your withholdings were more than enough especially when considering all your itemized deductions (especially your charity - nice job!). The business made a little bit more but the rental property made a little less as there were more repairs as we made sure to take every deduction we could - there was a paper "passive loss" that we will preserve and use in the future as necessary.

Slight refund this year again as wages went up a decent amount due to the change in job (congrats again!).  We got you the excess social security withheld of $2,709 due to Amy's switching jobs.  You did great with the dependent care account and we made sure it wasn't taxed.   We are still using your capital loss carryforward to reduce $3,000 of your taxable income and will do so until it is all used up. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income and the nature of it. Your business made about $12,000 after we took all possible business deductions. The good news is that there are very little tax penalties (aka interest) due to you this year - my system is calculating about $47. We agreed on quarterlies for the upcoming year of $1,200 federal if everything stayed the same - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. However you should let me know if you anticipate your business income going up a good amount as we should adjust this based on that. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Big increase in wages due to the MASSIVE Schrodinger stock option exercise. We made sure you weren't double taxed on that (your taxable gain on the actual trade is actually negative due to slight trading costs). Also made sure all your Relay trades were reported properly. Also made sure you got back the excess Social Security withholdings due to switching jobs. Still the withholdings wasn't enough on the options exercise and now you owe a good amount. Finally, the exercise and hold of the ISO Relay options gave you an extra $151k of "bargain element" income you had to recognize on Form 6251 for AMT purposes - however, this only added $4k in AMT tax to your overall bill, which is not bad considering how much options you exercised and the potential for long term capital gain.Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s.  You owe a good amoutn due to a big gain on your Relay ISO shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. It was amazing execution - your ISO was a great gain and all converted to long term. We made sure to increase the AMT cost basis for that trade to ensure that you got all AMT payments you made in previous years back (the amount is $3,998 and can be seen on line 6b of Schedule 3 of your return). The current year exercise and holds were under the AMT threshold which was great execution as well! Finally with respect to the RLAY trades we made the $101k gain from the QSBS trade non-taxable in both federal and MA returns.
We made sure to note Olivia's backdoor Roth conversion and make it non-taxable. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Again great gain on Acceleron! Without that gain you would have owed about $4,000 so I upped your quarterly payments slightly. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. BIG refund this year as you got most of your quarterlies back! Per mutual agreement we are cutting them in half now that you are no longer at Vertex. Your trades had some losses - we took the maximum $3k deduction against your regular income and are preserving the rest of the losses to use in future year. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks! 

2023

You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE increase in your wages due to BBIO stock vesting (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The stock vesting is withheld at 22% but you are now in the 35% tax bracket and so were underwithheld.  That said the automatic quarterlies we paid helped offset this and had you avoid penalty interest - nice!  For the upcoming period I recommend $6k quarterlies based on this year. We reported your trades and adjusted the cost basis but you still had a minimal gain. Also reported your dancing winnings!  Finally, made sure to note that you made a $6.5k contribution to your IRA.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Refund this year as you got $2,000 child tax credit for Walker (congrats again!) as well as  taking all possible deductions on the rentals to preserve suspended losses for the future.  You had no childcare expenses so your $5k dependent care account was added back in as taxable.  Everything else similar to previous year.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Very similar to last year results wise - another $5k refund! Your wages went up $118k and your withholdings kept up. We made sure to note your Section 83B election on your return. The rentals continue to cashflow nicely but don't affect you tax wise due to deprecation. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that Maryann started a business - we took every available deduction but she still made $12k (a good thing!) so now you owe tax on that. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your investment  income went up a bit due to increased interest.  Your wages went down $62k and your withholdings kept up for the most part.  Your business income stayed flat, and while rental revenue was up there was more than enough losses with depreciation to make it non-taxable.  Everything else looked good.  The only thing I would say is that after you get your bonuses please check in with me so we can run a projection to see how much you might owe next year and if they took enough out of it in taxes.

Broke the $1MM mark again! $750k of wage income from options combined with $50k of restricted stock vesting combined with about $18k of gains from your trades made for another very good year! We made sure to bump up the cost basis on your options trades so you weren't double taxed on that income. Additionally all that money allowed you to majorly upgrade the house/Batcave and we got you almost $10k worth of tax credits for all those upgrades (the maximum possible). Another great year for you - congrats - so happy for you guys. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Your wages went up over $500k BUT that also means the amount you owe went down a lot as well! Moderna stock income came in much lower that is why the income is down.

Nice refund this year as you got your quarterly payments almost exactly right - nice job!  I kept your automatic quarterly payments for next year the same at $5k per quarter.  We created a Schedule C as discussed to reflect your Reverb sales.  We also reflected your options exercises and holds to recognize "bargain element" income for AMT purposes - however this didn't result in any AMT - again nice job!  Also adjusted your AMT tax basis on the CCCC shares you sold that were previously ISO exercises and this helped save you about $1k in taxes.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

The Schedule C with your Reverb sales continues to show a minor loss. We also reflected your options exercises and holds to recognize "bargain element" income for AMT purposes - however this didn't result in any AMT - again nice job!

Very similar to last year income wise except your investment income was up by about $14k - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.

You had losses in your trades after we increased the cost basis to the proper amounts and we used the maximum amount ($154) to offset income.The thing that made you owe a bit less was that we got the last of the AMT tax credits to the turn of $19,713!  This really helped with what you owe and was a great result for you.  Based on this credit not being there going forward for you I think we should bump the quarterlies to $15,500 next year and you agreed.  Everything else looked good.

But even still you owe a decent amount but much better than previous years! Talk soon.

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  You owe a good amount this year because you had $530k of options income and $171k of restricted stock income vesting to your W2.  This was withheld at the standard 22% rate whereas you are squarely in the 37% tax bracket so this was underwithheld by a good amount.  Nothing you can do about it - just letting you know why you owe. 

The quarterlies obviously reduced what you owed AND prevented you from owing penalty interest now! You had gains in your stock trades even after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock but we used the loss carryforwards from last year to take it to zero and then deduct an extra $3k (the max we can do) against regular income. The rental made some good income but we took every deduction we could to get it down to zero taxable income.  

Being over $1MM in wages made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.

You had good quarterly payments though - between that and the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction for her business you swung to a refund! We noted Steven's new business and took all available deductions possible against that. The rental had a full year of income and had over $5,000 in income even after depreciation! Finally we noted your regular IRA contributions too bad you can't go directly to Roth but that's what happens when you make too much money! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

 Very similar to last year for the rental except you had a bit more in expenses so you have a slight loss.

We also reported your NY income and made sure you got your refund from there as well as credit on your CT return for the taxes paid to NY. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You are getting another refund but it is going down thanks to increased wages and income. Your wages went up $86k but your withholdings kept up. Phoebe's business looks like it's almost closed down as she has been hired as an employee but we reported the consulting income and took all available deductions to reduce her taxable income there to zero. We also reported your NY income and made sure you got your refund from there as well as credit on your CT return for the taxes paid to NY. Also let you know about erroneous NYC tax collections and got that back for you as well.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

We were SPOT ON with the quarterly payments - slight refund for federal and owing just a little to MA so kept the automatic quarterly payments the same for the upcoming year. Your rental is still cashflowing nicely and we used depreciation to ensure it has a taxable loss. Please let me know if any questions thanks!

p.s. We were again right on the mark with the quarterlies but the estate threw some "monkey wrenches" into the return. We discussed the sale of the inherited home and reported that on Form 8949 to make sure to report it properly. Finally, the IRA distribution had good withholdings on the federal side but for MA there was none and it's a good part of the reason why you owe so much to them.  
Otherwise, very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $74k and your withholdings kept up. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Your rental loss came down as your rent received went up - nice job! Agreed to keep the $2,500 quarterlies going. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $11k and your withholdings kept up and with the addition of the quarterlies you managed to keep what you owe down and avoid penalty interest. You had gains on your trades but we used prior year losses in your trades to offset them and then we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years yet again! Your rental loss again came down ever so slightly as your rent received went up - nice job! Agreed to up the quarterlies to $5,500. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Your business income was up $10k last year as I showed you when we met. Retirement distributions up almost twice as much. No big capital gains like last year. Good withholdings and good quarterly payments combined to put you right on track to a slight combined refund. I set your quarterlies up for next year using our special system. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Discussed and quarterlies given - will send reminders - have fun in Bermuda!

Your business income was down $100k last year and thus the quarterlies were more than enough to get you a decent refund. I got the mortgage interest from Roz and included it to get you a nice deduction for it and your charity.  Jim's retirement has been excluded when I did a projection for you and your quarterlies for this year and thus I have dialed back your quarterlies a good amount.  Everything else looked good.

Kolin - you might want to consider stopping NYC tax withholdings. You don't have to pay taxes in NYC anymore now that you live in White Plains. This is the reason for the huge NY refund. No big deal if you don't you'll just get a big refund from NY but just letting you know.

2022

p.s. BIG refund this year again as you got your NYC payments back AND you got $5,500 EV tax credit! That pushed you to a nice refund on the federal side and NY refund is "juiced" by the excess NYC withholdings - won't be like that again next year enjoy it while it lasts (and enjoy the extra money in your paycheck!). All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

 As predicted your NY refund came back to normal after no longer having excess NYC withholdings.  That said you owe on federal side which stinks.  As discussed with you your Kolin's wages went down $40k and his withholdings went down $16k - about 40% - a big drop in withholdings.  Anyways that's the main reason you owe I believe.  We continue to deduct your mortgage interest  and charity - a nice deduction for you.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

You continue to have a lot of income - a bit less than last year but still it means you owe a good amount every year. As we discussed, it's a good idea to make estimated payments and glad you decided to do it. You're doing GREAT with the ESPP made $20k on it last year! Hope you're enjoying the vacation home.

2022

p.s. You continue to have a lot of income - up $1.2MM this year! Next year get ready to get hit with the MA millionaire's tax - there's no way around it for you. Not a big deal as it will get taken directly out of your paycheck but anyways it's an extra 4% on income above $1MM. As we discussed, it's a good idea to make estimated payments and glad you decided to do it and we upped it to $32,500. Hope you're still doing the ESPP! I didn't see it on the W2 but you made $20k on it in 2021 so hopefully you're keeping that up. Hope all is well with you guys - let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your wages went up almost $116k and your withholdings kept up for the most part. The new thing was you were subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  You had healthy interest and dividends that increased $20k year over year. You had gains in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the company stock but they were all long term capital gains which gets taxed at the lowest possible tax rate.


We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We set you up with quarterlies for both federal and MA to account for the new MA millionaire's tax.


Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $38,911 by filing jointly to owing a total of $32,706, thus saving $6,205 by doing this!  This is a bit less than we thought because of the following:

1.	 Dependent care expense account of $5k ends up being taxed when doing married filing separately
2.	You had loss carryforwards from previous year and we were only able to use half of them to offset the gain on Jaime's stock sales

But still - a win is a win!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

BIG refund this year as your wages went down a good bit as well as we made sure the amounts contributed to your dependent care account weren't taxed.  Got the tax credit from your repayment last year to Vertex - the calculation is in the statement in the tax return - saved you $10,342 in taxes nice!  Finally, made sure to take every deduction possible against your business income.  I kept you at the same quarterlies because this was a "weird" year and pretty sure this won't repeat itself.  Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Nice refunds again! Your wages went up $53k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing this year was your incentive stock options exercise - we made sure to account for that properly and will track it for you going forward. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Everything was almost the same as last year - you owe a little bit but basically your withholdings were SPOT ON!  No quarterlies like previous years meant no refund but that's ok as you didn't give the government an interest free loan.

Another good year for you! You owe more because Betty is making some good money in her business. Talk to you this afternoon!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $44k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before but additionally there is income from Betty that has no federal or state tax withholdings (the partnership income) as well as no state tax withholdings (the distribution from New Hampshire Retirement System). There was some slight gains in the trades after bumping up the cost basis so you weren't double taxed. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and see you tomorrow!

p.s. Similar to last year income wise - however you owe a decent amount but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $50k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket . The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had long term capital gains of $14k because of Vertex sales. Per discussion with you, set you up with $2,000 automatic quartlerlies which will help for next year. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

BIG refund this year as you got all of your quarterly payments back.  We also got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to Kate's switching jobs back.  We took all possible tax deductions on Mark's business return, including the home office deduction.  I split the business return between NH and MA so half of the income wasn't taxed for state purposes.  I obviously did not set you up with quarterly payments for next year based on this result but if the business return starts making more than $35-40k we should talk about making them.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well and congrats again on the move - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Wage income was down last year. Switch in jobs led to excess social security withholdings of $3,300 which really helped boost your refund this year. We made sure the backdoor Roth's were not taxable. No need to recognize "bargain element" income for AMT tax purposes due to valuation on 4/19/2021, which helped out as well. All in all a great result. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022


p.s. You owe a good amount due to a big gain in Elizabeth's business income (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the marginal rate and is also subject to self employment taxes, but gives you the opportunity to do a SEP IRA to reduce your taxes (which I discussed with you). I believe we discussed not paying quarterlies last year but that was assuming you made only $25k in your business and you obviously did much better. There are no tax penalties for owing this year but we agreed to set up automatic quarterly payments for next year at $6k to federal and $1k to MA. Great talking to you today!

You owe a bit more to federal because your wages went up a good amount and your withholdings didn't keep up. That said, Ethan saved you $2,000! Your RI taxes went up a bit because you made more money and crossed a threshold where the RI standard deduction and personal exemptions went away. We populated your rental and carried forward your suspended losses - that said the losses were all due to depreciation - it looks like it's cashflowing nicely! Let me know if any questions - thanks.

Your wages went up $81k and your withholdings kept up. You had unemployment income this year which we accounted for. We accounted for the ISO exercises and it added about $2k to your tax burden - just like we predicted in the scenario we ran back in 2022. The rental is very similar to last year. Finally we made sure to account for both of your $6k IRA contributions so we can do the tax free rollover to a Roth next year. Everything else looked good.

We accounted for the ISO exercises and it added about $2.5k to your tax burden - not too bad compared to the amount you exercised. The rental did $4k better than last year.

The new thing that will make you owe MA a bit more next year is the millionaire's tax - I guess the good news is that you are making more than a million now but the bad news is that there is an additional 4% tax on income in MA over $1MM - so if you make $1,000,100 then you will owe an extra $4 on that $100. Just a heads up - it's not like you should try to make less money to avoid it but just something to be aware of.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $91k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid more than 110% of the previous year's taxes owed (the "safe harbor" rule). I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $4,000 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.

I have run a married filing separately vs married filing jointly analysis which is sent to you - you can see that by filing jointly you save about $1,200.

The good news is that my system calculates there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due but that may not be the case next year if this keeps up. I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $4k federal starting in June- this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You also had a good amount of income from Astrid's speaking, etc. that had no withholdings. If this keeps up I would suggest doing quarterlies - I have provided them to you based on this year's numbers in case you want to do them.

Made sure you account for your $2k in income from Pinnacle as well. Finally we advised you about your SEP IRA contribution opportunity.

You owe a good amount due to big gains on your Nuance shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  Your rental continues to make great money even after depreciation.  You have $11k more in rental income this year vs. last because last year we bonus depreciated your boiler.  Made sure to exclude the $5k dependent care expenses as being taxable.  All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022


p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $87k and your withholdings kept up for the most part. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had gains in your trades even after bumping up the cost basis for the Nuance stock - a good thing except now when you have to pay. That said it's all long term. The rental continues to cash flow nicely, a great investment for you. Finally, we continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your wages went down almost $105k and your withholdings, combined with the quarterly payments, kept up to get you a good refund from federal and right in the ballpark - nice!  You had healthy interest and dividends that increased $4k year over year. 

For the rental, we continued to report the usual revenues and expenses BUT this year you sold it so we had to account for that.  You had a big gain on the sale (partly due to depreciation lowering your cost basis) BUT we also got to take the capital losses of $100k we had planned on for this occasion to wipe out some of that gain.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

As stated previously, damage not too bad compared to other years! Wages down a bit and no Vertex trades limited the damages, I believe. You still had some good investment income but it didn't move the needle too much. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $61k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket. Your rental is doing very similar to last year, as well as your itemized deductions (mortgage interest and charity). You had $24k of long term capital gains (the best kind! and good to have gains) Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your wages went up almost $5k and your withholdings, combined with the quarterlies, helped reduce the amount you owe on the MASSIVE gain from the sale of your rental in NH!  You still owe a good amount though due to how big the gain was - without that gain you would have only owed $11k to federal.  You had healthy interest and dividends that were $14k. 

For the rental, we continued to report the usual revenues and expenses BUT this year you sold it so we had to account for that.  You had a big gain on the sale (partly due to depreciation lowering your cost basis) BUT we also got to take the passive loss of $13k we had been saving for this occasion to wipe out some of that gain.

Congrats on the move to Texas and Nick's retirement - exciting stuff!  With regards to your taxes, you owe a bit more due to the payout on retirement - your wages went up $262k and your withholdings didn't keep up.  You had good gains on your trades which is another reason why you owe.  We reported Samir's business income and took all possible deductions to reduce that taxable income.  Finally, we got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to Nick's switching jobs back.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. After the Verizon retirement, your wages went down $215k but the amount you owe also went down a lot! and your withholdings kept up. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Tony's business continued to grow and more than doubled the amount of income he had coming in after taking all available deductions. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and glad to see you doing so well in Texas!

Your wages went down $95k and your withholdings kept up and you swung to a refund! You had gains in your trades and we used the loss carryforward from last year to reduce it but you still had slight gains even after we adjusted the cost basis on your VZ trades.  Still good to have a gain.  Tony's business continued at the same pace and we took all available deductions to reduce his income. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope you're enjoying those cars!

Your wage income continues to climb and you owe about $4k more than last year. I believe this is due to the substantial restricted stock vesting (a good thing) which has withholdings at 22% federally and you are in the 35% tax bracket, leading to substantial under withholdings on that income. Glad we decided on the $6k quarterlies it will really help and should put you in good stead for next year.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a big amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $188k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. Additionally you had some great capital gains of $56k (22k of which were short term) which added to the tax burden. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $10k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. However upon discussion with your financial planner we are sticking with $6k quarterlies which we have set up for you. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year income wise again as your wage income went up a big amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $93k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. Additionally you had some great capital gains of $7k which added to the tax burden. You have tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid lower quarterlies than necessary throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $13.5k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.

Wow - you guys had a lot of different jobs last year!  Your wages went up $60k and your withholdings mostly kept up.  You would have owed but you got the excess social security withheld of $17,708 due to your switching jobs back.  Finally, made sure to note your backdoor Roth conversions.  Everything else looked similar to last year.  All in all, a great result for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news (probably due to lower value of stock compensation vesting). That said, it means you have a GREAT refund this year! Dividend and interest income way up that's good as well. Everything else looks good we took all the losses on your trades as a deduction against your regular income. Let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Everything remained almost exactly the same as the previous year except you have unemployment income and excess social security due to Emeka having more than one job.  This amount of $9,523 was refunded to you now and thus reduced the amount you owe to $4k this year instead of $13k - nice!  You did great with your investment income which almost doubled to $18k.

p.s. Very similar to last year except this year you had some great gains in your trades - all long term but still it added to your tax burden. Between that and the rentals which continue to cashflow so nicely (and you continue to raise rents nice!) it made you owe a bit this year. Still it's nothing compared to the "old days" and thus I adjusted your automatic quarterlies to $6,000 to reflect this new situation. Finally Brooke has a business!

2021
You owe a bit due to a decent gain on the sale of your rental (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. The reason you have a gain is because of depreciation recapture - you get a tax break up front on your rental but they track the depreciation and now tax you on it. That said, we also tracked your suspended losses on the rental and used that to offset your gain. We set up your return so that you are partial residents in both CA and MA and taxed accordingly. As discussed, please adjust the state withholdings on your military pension as it is taxable in CA. Finally, we got you the excess social security withheld due to both of you switching jobs. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are enjoying CA - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. No rental gain and now you swing into a refund - nice! Your overall wages went down $48k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that helped you out were no big capital gains due to either stock sales or the rental sale. Based on this I am taking your automatic quarterly payments down to $8,000 per quarter - let me know if that's ok. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You owe a bit due to some nice increase in your wage income due to switching jobs - nice!  Your wages went up $180k last year.   We set up your return so that you are partial residents in both CA and CO and taxed accordingly. As discussed, please adjust the state withholdings on your military pension as it is taxable in CO. Next year we will itemize to take full advantage of your mortgage interest (this year you didn't have enough for it to exceed the standard deduction so we used that larger deduction instead).  Finally, we got you the excess social security withheld due to Shawn switching jobs. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are enjoying Colorado - let me know if any questions - thanks!

You would have owed about $12k to federal and very little to MA without the HUGE long term capital gains on the trades (good to have gains, and they were taxed at the most favorable rate). Still having that much in gains is the reason why you owe how much you owe. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

As I told you last year, "You would have owed about $12k to federal and very little to MA without the HUGE long term capital gains on the trades" and this is the year that prediction comes to fruition as that is about what you owe. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.

You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE amount of gains on your stock trades (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the short term capital gains rate.  It would have been a $180k gain but we used $30k of current year long term capital losses to offset them and then another $20k of capital loss carryforwards from previous years to lower it some more.  Without the trades you would have $5k to federal and hardly anything to the states.  Finally, we split your tax return to properly allocate income to MA and MD and file in both states.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are enjoying MD - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Welcome to Maryland - the land of refunds! A more normal income year for you with no big capital gains. Your wages were up $39k and your withholdings kept up. You owe a bit but not much in MD. We made sure to take the $1,200 spousal deduction in MD for lower wage earnings of a spouse. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if you have any questions thanks!
"Maryland provides a deduction for two-income married couples who file a joint income tax return. When both you and your spouse have taxable income, you may subtract up to $1,200 or the income of the spouse with the lower income, whichever is less. The income can be from wages, pensions, or business income."

You are getting a nice refund due to some good withholdings - nice! We made sure to adjust the cost basis of the options trades so you weren't double taxed.

Everything else was straightforward. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well.

I would recommend quarterlies for the upcoming year of $9k federal if you think this will be the same going forward - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.

You owe a LOT this year but not unexpected as you had huge AMT due to ISO exercise and holds and no tax withholdings on Jeanne's exercise and sell immediately of her $915k of ISO exercises. We projected this back in December I believe. We were able to reduce your capital gain on the NTLA ESPP trade by selling Tom's ISO exercise. The $100k in charity fund saved you $37,000 in taxes which is great. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022


p.s. No AMT on your ISO Exercises nice! That said, you owe a bit more than we discussed via zoom because the AMT tax credits we were able to get from the previous year was reduced due to the ISO stock exercises. You had a MASSIVE $422k gain on your Intellia shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate and you really worked the ISO exercise and hold strategy to perfection on this one.We will continue to file to preserve the AMT tax credits you have which we will be able to utilize when AMT taxable income is lower than regular tax income (which happened this year and should happen again in the future when you sell the shares you exercised and held in 2022).All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Nice refund this year for the first time in a while!  Wages were up $112k from last year and your withholdings more than kept up.  We added the new rental to your tax return and took all possible tax deductions, including depreciation.  We allocated ? of expenses to the rental and ? to your itemized deductions (where appropriate).  It's pretty amazing but it's cashflowing nicely - $6k of taxable income even AFTER depreciation (most rentals don't cashflow like this - it's due to the low purchase price you have from way back when you bought it I believe so it's a great investment for you obviously).  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest for the new place in Winchester.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well and congrats again on the move - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $107k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Alkermes which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $6,000 to federal and you agreed - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Additionally made sure to increase the tax basis on your ISO exercise and sell immediately as you were already taxed on it in your wages, saving you from paying taxes on $6,129 again. Your trades were winners - mostly long term which is great. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.  

2023

Your wage income again went up a good amount and you had good investment income - therefore you owe a good amount.

I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $11,000 to federal and you agreed - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.

Nice result as compared to last year - you just owe a little bit!  You had good withholdings on the one significant 1099-R IRA distributions good job!  And good job on the W2 withholdings as well.  Julie we reported your income from your job - nice.  Finally a nice addition to your income was the rental down the Cape - you made $15k after expenses (we have to adjust them for personal use as well) for just 30 days of rent - sweet!  Please let me know if any questions on any of this - thanks and hope all is well!

2021
Another year of great refunds! Good withholdings on all your retirement withholdings as well as your W2 continues to lead to good federal refund. The student loan interest is all tax deductible in MA which also leads to a great refund there. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income and refund wise - nice! Your wages went up $35k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that Donna's business swung to an $8,000 profit - great stuff. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Again everything was very similar to last year income and refund wise - nice! Your wages went up $35k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you get a bigger refund was that Donna's business was about $6,000 less than last year due to increased expenses. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021
Massive increase in wages last year (due to Ian leaving the Death Star and exercising all his options) and the corresponding 22% withholdings on that stock compensation leads to you owing more than in previous years. You did great with the dependent care account over $10k not taxable! Great dividends and gains on trades all long term Tucker doing right by you. Everything else looks the same as previous years - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

Broke the million mark! Still with some tax planning and an advance payment you are getting a refund this year - unreal - it's like Roger Bannister breaking the 4 minute mile - people never thought it could happen and then he just went out and did it! You owe a little in MA but overall still a refund. Slight long term capital gains in your Vertex trades last year when adjusted for proper cost basis so that you aren't double taxed. Congrats - happy for you guys! Hope all is well up there on the North Shore!

2023

Your wages were above $1.5MM and unfortunately your withholdings didn't keep up federally - you owe a good amount even after the $100k payment.  As Ian and I discussed today there were low withholdings on that final bonus payout as well as healthy investment income of $230,000 that had no withholdings whatsoever.  I sent over the spreadsheet where we went through that for your reference.  And to pile injury upon injury being over $1MM in wages and other income made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  

Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $40,964 by filing jointly to owing a total of $22,441 between both of you, thus saving $18,523 by doing this!  I claimed your daughter Paige on Jacq's state tax return to reduce taxable income due to dependent care benefits as well.  

On the federal signature pages there is a "Transaction Summary" that shows all payments and refunds where you initial to confirm your bank account. Please IGNORE what it says for MA state as far as what you owe there. This is what you would have owed if we filed jointly. I include this Summary because I think it's important for you to see all your refunds and payments in one place but rest assured the MA numbers are the ones on the signature pages you each sign separately

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and talk soon!

2021

Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news. That said, it means you have an even better refund this year!  Your wages went down $26k and your withholdings kept up.  The new thing that gave you a bit more of a refund was that you had a loss in your rental and we were able to write it off against your wage income.  Everything else looked good and remained similar to last year.  All in all, a great result for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. The exact inverse of last year! Wages were up a bit last year which is good news! That said, it means your refund went down a bit this year  Your wages went up $38k and your withholdings kept up.   Everything else looked good and remained similar to last year. Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Wages were flatlined when compared to last year (right around $150k) even though the path towards that number was volatile as you had two jobs.  We made sure to account for your unemployment income as well as withholdings on it.  We created a business return (Schedule C) for your consulting income and took every possible deduction we could to lower that income. The end result due to some great withholdings was a great refund!  Let me know if any questions - thanks!
Client 282 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
Your wages keep going up by $100k each year over the past 2 years - a good thing!  Your withholdings haven't kept up but still the amount you owe is not bad relative to your income.  We made sure that the $10k set aside in the dependent care account wasn't taxable.  Everything else remains the same.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - except this year you're back to a nice refund! Your wages went down $38k so your taxes went down but your withholdings stayed the same. We got you the dependent care credit of $1,200 for your daycare spending. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Very similar to last year again another nice refund! Your wages went down $30k so your taxes went down and your withholdings did as well but not too much to prevent you from getting a higher refund.  We got you the dependent care account of $5,000 to be tax free nice! We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a great deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks again!

Almost the EXACT same as last year - nice refund! Talk soon......

2022
p.s. MONSTER refund for you this year as you got ALL your tax owed offset by the electric vehicle - congratulations! I made sure to note your Roth contribution as well. Everything else looked good - please reach out to me after tax season to set up a time to talk - thanks!
Client 284

2021

You owe a good bit more than last year due to a big gain on your sale of your Alexion shares due to the merger (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!) as well as a big increase in your wages.  The trading gain is taxed as short term capital gains rate.  We split your return so that half of your investment income was in Florida where you resided for the first half of the year, but the trades are allocated based on when you sell.  You were in MA when you sold the Alexion shares, so that is why you owe MA.  Finally, made sure to note your $6k contribution to your IRA.  All in all, a great year for you - finally done!  Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. You owe a good bit less than last year to the feds due to getting $9k of excess social security back as well as being able to deduct a full year's worth of mortgage interest. Unfortunately that was offset a bit by owing MA for not having MA tax withholdings. Please followup with your company to fix that. Everything else looked good. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

You owe about the same as last year due to good gains on your trades as well as no withholdings on your unemployment income.  We continue to deduct a full year's worth of mortgage interest as well as charity. We added your rental and took all possible deductions as well as capitalized your renovations so you can depreciate that going forward.  Finally wrote off your worthless stock.  Everything else looked good. Let me know if any questions - thanks!
Client 285

2021

Great refunds! Great wages for you last year and glad we ran projections - just a little bit over in our estimates but better to be safe than sorry! Itemized to match your soon to be ex-husband's filing. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. You owed a bit but not too much given your overall income. We set up automatic quarterlies of $1k for each quarter to help out with this situation. We bumped up the cost basis on your Moderna trades so you wouldn't be double taxed. Itemized again to match your soon to be ex-husband's filing. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks!

2023

Nice refunds!  Based on this situation I don't think you need to do quarterlies.  We made sure to use the single filing status to reflect the finalization of your divorce.  We again bumped up the cost basis on your Moderna trades so you wouldn't be double taxed. Finally we itemized to make sure to take advantage of your mortgage interest and real estate tax paid. Please let me know if you have any questions and hope all is well!

2021
Lot went on last year! Got married, new job, lots of stock trades (some nice gains in there) - you owe a little bit but less than in previous years. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Same result (owing $2k) but got there in a different way! Lots of trades with some long term capital gains even after adjusting the cost basis of the Vertex stock to their true cost. The rental at a full year is really cashflowing nicely - showing a profit even after depreciation! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if you have any questions thanks and hope all is well!

2023

You owe just a little bit this year as both your wages and withholdings continue to go up in lockstep and keep you in good shape come tax time.  You had some great rental income again and we made sure to take every possible expense to reduce it.  We itemized your deductions to decrease the amount you owed to the federal government taking advantage of your mortgage interest on your main residence.  You did great with the dependent care and child tax credit - getting $2,600 back for Otto!  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Good catching up - great retirement contributions!

2023

Another great year in your business!  You maxed our your SEP IRA contributions which really helped reduce your taxable income and turbocharge your retirement.  Nice job on the tax payments too - we provided you quarterly vouchers based on this year's experience in case you want to use them.  All in all a great year for you - talk soon! 
Client 288

2021

You owed a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on your Translate Bio shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain for the restricted stock is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  For the ESPP it is taxed at short term capital gains rates.  Your mortgage interest deduction just started so we are still taking the standard deduction but next year you'll itemize as you'll have a full year's worth of mortgage interest. You and Steve did a great job estimating your taxes - the reason you are getting a refund is you made the $12k for the IRA conversion to Roth taxable (it's not) and you didn't give yourself credit for the Medicare tax withholdings of about 10k that is on your W2 to pay the Additional Medicare Tax.  Let's keep the call on Monday to talk about your consulting business and answer any questions you may have there.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Nice refund! You are getting most of your quarterly payments back. Your business is doing well and we made sure you maxed out your SEP IRA (to the proper amount). We also noted your $6,000 IRA contribution. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owed a good amount due to a nice year in your business and some healthy dividends of $23k (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  We made sure to reduce your taxable income through your SEP IRA contribution of $20k.  We also made the $6k for the IRA conversion to Roth not taxable. We talked about upcoming quarterlies and decided to hold off for now until June - just be in touch whenever you need help on that or get clarity on your employment situation.  Let me know if any questions - thanks and have fun on your trip to Europe!

2021

Similar to last year's return except more wage income meant you owed a bit more in taxes. The trades were losers - we got to use $3k of it to offset regular income and the rest of it is carried forward for use in future years. We set up your rental property for the future as well - we offset the rent by using expenses but there is no loss to carry forward there as it was used for the majority of the year as a personal residence. But we have set up the rental and the improvements so they will be depreciated going forward. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $134k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $5,000 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Finally, the rental is cashflowing GREAT - making money even after depreciation - nice! Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went down a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $120k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended the same quarterlies for the upcoming year of $5,000 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. We made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity.  Finally, the rental is still cashflowing nicely - making a slight loss after depreciation which is good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021

Nice refund! Arciere got you an additional $2,350 - way to get him into 2021! Not enough mortgage interest to deduct this year but next year you should be itemizing and taking full advantage. Let me know if any questions -

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you still have a nice refund! The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that $7k Chris got from the Commonwealth that had no withholdings on it - still a good thing to get but now you need to pay some taxes on it. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Wages up about $33k last year and your withholdings kept up. Everything else looks good we are not deducting your mortgage interest as it less than your standard deduction.  You got the $2k child tax credit as well as $600 for your energy improvements.  Let me know if any questions - thanks and hope you're doing good!
Client 291 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
Slightly lower wages offset by a good increase in Matt's business income meant that you had more income and thus owe a bit more. That said, Callahan's child tax credit as well as the stimulus payment gave you $5,000! So that really helped. If things stay the same you should anticipate owing in the $8k to $9k range next year - let me know if you want me to set up automatic quarterly payments for you and I can do so - thanks.

2022

p.s. As predicted last year things stayed the same and so you owe in the $8k to $9k range. Everything looked the same except you had an extra $5k in unemployment income. We discussed a SEP IRA for your business as well. Hope you're doing well thanks!
Client 292

2021
Very similar year to last year except you had about $40k lower in gains from your trades. The quarterlies worked out great as you are getting a slight refund so set you up with automatic quarterlies in the same amount again for the upcoming year. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you still have a good refund though due to the quarterlies and no longer having massive stock vesting from Vertex. Your wages went up $42k and your withholdings kept up - this is most likely due to no longer having the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22%. I have recommended lower quarterlies for the upcoming year of $3,000 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. I want to keep them going for one more year just to make sure that you are ok through your new job. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went down a good amount due to no longer having the restricted stock vests from Vertex - you still have a good refund though due to the quarterlies.  I have recommended the same quarterlies for the upcoming year of $3,000 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Nice gains on your trades is why you owe in MA.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and always good seeing you!

Client 293 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
Big increase in wages combined with decrease in mortgage interest paid (a good thing) led to your refund going down a bit but still it is a good refund.  We got you the excess social security withheld of $2,719 due to Kamna's switching jobs as well as $1,600 child care credit as well as $2,000 child tax credit.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - nice refunds! Your wages went up $49k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you get more back was excess social security withholdings due to Ray's switching jobs - that got you more then $4k back. Additionally you got the $1,200 child tax credit. Finally we advised you to take out the excess 401k contributions - we have included that as income this year so you won't have to amend 2022 tax return when we get the form next year. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Your wages increased yet again due to a job change but unfortunately your withholdings didn't keep up and now you owe a good amount (but no penalties happened).  That said I would recommend quarterlies of $3,000 per quarter to get ahead of this situation as when Ray switched jobs something must have happened with the withholdings and now they are low (only 16% withholdings on his federal taxes whereas you are in the 32% tax bracket right now with average tax rate of 22%).  We made sure to itemize as the standard deduction is lower than your state and real estate tax paid (capped at $10,000) and mortgage interest and charity combined.  Finally as you are making more than $400,000 you are starting to lose the child tax credit of $2,000 per child - last year you got the full $4,000 for your two children but this year you are only getting $850 for it.  However, you did great with the dependent care account in maxxing it out at $5k and we made sure it wasn't taxed.  Glad you are upping your withholdings to reflect this new situation.  Let me know if any questions - thanks.
Client 294 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
Very similar to last year except you were advanced $2k of the child tax credit so your refund is reduced by that amount. Paige's business is doing better this year. I made sure you weren't taxed on that options exercise gain as it was already taxed as wages in your W2. Any questions let me know thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year except this year your wages went up a lot due to $114k of options exercised ($84k of which you held). I made sure you weren't taxed on that options exercise gain on the shares you sold as it was already taxed as wages in your W2. Paige's business is doing even better this year and broke even - nice! Any questions let me know thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Your wages went down a lot due no options exercised this year.  However you had more than $200k of long term capital gains (with a lot of trades!) which are taxed at the most favorable tax rate but nevertheless you owe even after I adjusted for the proper cost basis.  Paige's business had a loss after all the deductions and we used it to reduce your taxes a little.  Finally my software is calculating that you owe about $1,500 in penalty interest for being underwithheld during the tax year - this happens when you have paid less than 90% of the amount owed when you come in to file your return.  Any questions let me know thanks and looking forward to our zoom!
Client 295 - Married Filing Jointly

2022


p.s. You owe a good amount but again not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $213k and your withholdings didn't keep up as much as they should have and thus you owe a bit more. The new thing was that due to no repairs your rental was positive income even after depreciation - nice! We used passive losses to offset that income. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages were down from last year but just slightly - it's a very similar story to last year just that you have much more medical expenses which increased your itemized deductions by $28k after factoring in the 7.5% excess of adjusted gross income threshold to be allowed to deduct medical expenses. You should track your medical expenses going forward so you can easily give them to me if this continues to be the case.  Another thing that happened was you "dipped your toe" into the new MA millionaire's tax which we discussed is another reason why you owed in MA.  It only added $700 though.  Finally we adjusted the cost basis on your company trades to make sure you didn't get hit with a massive tax!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Client 297 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

Your wages went up $144k(nice!) and your withholdings kept up.  The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that the NY partnership income doubled!  We were able to use the loss on the rental to reduce it by $10k but still it added a good amount to what you owe (but that's a good thing it's still more money at the end of the day!).  I obviously brought up your automatic quarterly payments for next year to reflect the current situation - please let me know if you want me to set it up to be paid automatically and I can do that.  Everything else looked good.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise except higher quarterlies have you owing much less - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $50k and your withholdings kept up. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that Ruth had a retirement distribution - she should make sure to have MA withholdings done on that going forward. We removed your rental as that is no longer happening - congrats on the move! Finally the automatic quarterlies for both federal and NY State were spot on so going to keep them there again this year. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 298 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
A healthy raise in wages plus some business income (which we reduced as much as possible) led to an increase in your tax owed. I think more and more of Mike's income is coming in stock which is withheld at 22% but you are in 32% tax bracket with increased income so have some underwithholdings due to that. You might want to consider quarterly payments of $1,500 each (I can set them up to happen automatically) or you can just be prepared to owe come tax time each year. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $36k and your withholdings kept up. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due because of the quarterlies you paid nice! You had gains in your trades of $6.6k (all long term) and we excluded the $95,000 gain on the sale of your condo - nice! Finally would like to continue to do quarterlies and set them up to happen automatically so that's what we've set up for you. That said, would like to increase them to $4,500 per quarter. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Second verse almost the same as the first!  Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $151k and your withholdings kept up. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due because of the quarterlies you paid nice! You had gains in your trades of $38k ($32k long term)! We also got you all the energy tax credits that we could! Also glad to hunt down that mortgage interest deduction for you!  Finally would like to continue to do quarterlies and set them up to happen automatically so that's what we've set up for you. That said, would like to increase them to $5,000 per quarter. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021

Very similar to last year income wise - you got a nice refund but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages and business income were almost exactly the same.  We set the max SEP IRA contribution to be $47,980 so please make sure to contribute an additional $8,980 by April 18th.  Your trading gains were all long term which is good.   The new thing that made you owe a bit more (but still a good thing) was that your mortgage interest was lower so you didn't have enough deductions to exceed the standard deduction so we take the higher standard deduction now.  I set quarterlies up for next year based on this year's results.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Again very very similar to last year income wise - you got a nice refund but not too much considering your overall income. Your business income was almost exactly the same while your wages went up about $40k. We set the max SEP IRA contribution to be $47,793 so please make sure to contribute that amount by April 18th. Your had losses in your trading and we deducted them. We took as much dependent care expenses as we could for Simon - be aware that we can only do this until his 13th birthday. I set quarterlies up for next year based on this year's results and our conversation with you.  All in all, another great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

The rental property continues to cashflow nicely now there is hardly any depreciation so you made more than $16k on it last year. The business income was down but still more than $100k. All in all a great year for you and now you owe so little congrats! PLEASE REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE SET UP YOUR TAX RETURN TO BE PAID ELECTRONICALLY FROM YOUR TD BANK ACCOUNT ENDING IN 8669 ON APRIL 15TH.  IN ADDITION THE FIRST QUARTER PAYMENTS OF $7,000 FEDERAL AND $1,500 MA ARE COMING OUT ON THAT DATE AS WELL.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and congrats again!

Very similar to last year income wise except no business income from either of you combined with a loss on the rental means you are getting a refund!  Your wages went up $6k and your withholdings kept up.  Everything else looked good and similar to last year.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.  All in all, a great result for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Again very similar to last year income wise but with a slightly increased refund this year - nice! Your wages went up $14k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit less was that you had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. The rental cashflow continues to improve as less expenses this year and almost to breakeven when you take out the depreciation. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Again very similar to last year income wise BUT Julia went from 2 jobs in 2022 making around $58k with withholdings at Bowdoin  to one job with Maine School Admin making around the same amount with zero federal withholdings and thus you owe instead of the usual refund.  You should most likely start federal withholdings on this job if the wages there are going to continue at the same rate.  We continue to use the maximum amount ($3,000) of your loss carry forward to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. The rental cashflow continues to improve as less expenses this year and is a profit when you take out the depreciation. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Very similar to last year in all respects except you got $2,400 of your refund ahead of time as monthly child tax credit payments. Glad we got that Santander mortgage statement in! Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Again very similar to last year income wise but this time getting an even bigger refund - nice! Your wages went up $21k and your withholdings kept up. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you! In addition getting $4,000 child tax credit for the kids. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Your wages went up $21k and your withholdings kept up. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you! In addition getting $2,500 child tax credit for the kids - this went down by $1,500 because Edward turned 17 and thus gets $500 now instead of $2,000. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2021
Whoa what a year for you guys! Shedded assets while gaining CASH! A massive buyout increased your wage income to over $2MM - based just on that without the sale of the rentals you would have owed $75k to fed and $40k to AZ. With the BIG gains on the sales of your properties, the amount owed increased a good bit but that is because of the huge gain on the sale - some nice appreciation you have going there. We allocated 78% of the sale of Vermont to your primary residence and thus we were able to exclude almost $470k of gain on that sale due to the home sale exclusion rule. We also took all the suspended losses on the rentals (about $79k) to offset the rental sale gains. So we were able to mitigate the damage somewhat. Still - all in all you guys really seem to be doing great - so happy for you! Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

Your wages went up $213k and your withholdings kept up for the most part - you owe but it's not much relative to your income. The new thing that made you owe a bit less this year was through Tim having two W2s from where he worked he had $22,541 of excess 401k withholdings. We will have to amend this tax return next year when we get the 1099-R showing this as taxable income.  The good news with having two W2s is you got $9k back for excess social security withholdings to reduce your amount owed.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and always great to talk to you!

Income wise your wages went up $35k and your withholdings kept up.  However you owe a good amount due to gains on your trades (mostly Vertex).  We adjusted the cost basis of the Vertex trades to make sure that you weren't taxed on the whole thing, but you still had a healthy gain due to share price growth.  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate and offset by $26k of short term capital gains.  You would have owed $20k overall if you had no trading income. We also got you the excess social security withheld due to John's having 2 jobs back.  All in all, another good year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on your Vertex shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed through your salary due to options exercise income and restricted stock. We reported all trades and made sure to use the correct cost basis to determine your gains on your trades. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. I noticed Kathryn made the same amount of money in her job but her withholdings went down about $5,000 which contributed to why you owed a bit more as well. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

You again owe a LOT due to your Vertex wages and in particular your Block Island Family W2 having particularly low federal withholdings. We reported all trades and made sure to use the correct cost basis to determine your gains on your trades. You had gains in your Vertex trades even after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock but we used the losses from your other trades and the loss carryforwards from last year to wipe them out.  We then used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Your dividends and interest at $77k were particularly good.  We made sure to report your K1s properly.  Finally we created tax returns for your daughters as they had trades and thus necessitated a separate return.  They had significant gains and thus were subject to the "kiddie tax" on unearned income about $2,500.  (https://www.getearlybird.io/blog/utma-tax-rules)  Please let me know if you have any questions on any of this - thanks!

Set the quarterlies up like we discussed - be prepared for the money to come out on those dates! Also payment is coming out on April 18th for the amounts owed this year so have that ready too! Hope you are doing well and Desi still thanks you for the bandage you gave him!

2022
p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your business and wage income went up about $10k - you owe a good bit again but not as much as you would have considering you made those 3 quarterly payments (phew!). A big difference is last year you got a $2,800 stimulus payment which you didn't get this year (it expired as it was a covid thing) - with that you would have owed in the $2k range. Anyways, the good news is that the quarterly payments really helped out! That said they weren't enough to get you to breakeven so I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. I know you don't want to do automatic but even a little bit ($1,000) helps come now - you would be owing $10k right now without those automatic quarterlies. After discussion you decided not to and that's ok - just be sure to save some money for next April. Please let me know if any questions or thoughts - thanks.

BIG refund this year as you got $2,000 child tax credit for all of your kids due to your income dropping below $400k.  Not only that you didn't make any money on your trades so you are getting all the estimated tax payment you made as well as the payments you made with the extension.  Everything else looks good and similar to previous years.   FYI - preserving the $14,625 carryforward loss on the trades for future years to offset future trading gains as well as take $3k loss as a deduction against regular income (like we did this year). Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a LOT - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $339k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid a quarterly payment at the end of the year. Additionally you had $104k of long term capital gains even after I adjusted the Vertex cost basis to be the true basis - a good result for you but now you have to pay tax on it. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Every thing else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Your wages went down $117k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket . The good news is that you don't owe that much because of your quarterly payment.  That said my system is showing that you owe tax penalties (aka interest) of $732 due to you having paid a quarterly payment at the end of the year. Additionally you had $49k of capital gains even after I adjusted the Vertex cost basis to be the true basis - a good result for you but now you have to pay tax on it. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Finally got your some energy efficient tax credits - nice!  Everything else looked good.

Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news but it means you are back to a slight refund this year! Obviously the quarterlies are really helping and doing their job so I kept everything the same for next year.  We used your capital loss carryforward to reduce your trading gains to zero and used an extra $3k to reduce regular income and you still have $28k left to carryforward to future years.   Of course continuing to deduct your state and local taxes (capped at $10k), mortgage interest and charity.  Everything else looks good.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Of course continuing to deduct your state and local taxes (capped at $10k), mortgage interest and charity.

Howevre now you've got to pay taxes on it…..I've set it up to be paid electronically on April 15th.  I also printed vouchers for you for next year - if you anticipate having a similar year these are a good idea to do as it won't make this time so painful.

BIG refund this year as you got nearly all of your quarterly payments back due to your sale on the rental having a big long term capital gain (due to depreciation) but we simultaneously FINALLY get to realize all those passive losses that we've been preserving (almost $300k worth) to bring your total gain from the sale of the rental down to about $30k.  Slight long term capital gains in your Vertex trades last year when adjusted for proper cost basis so that you aren't double taxed.  We made sure to note your $7k contributions to your IRA's.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!  (btw next year the charge for you would revert back to $850 - this year involved a good bit more work to effectuate the sale of the rental properly)

We reported all trades and made sure to use the correct cost basis to determine your gains on your trades. We also reported Deb's business which had a small loss which we were allowed to deduct.

ANDY NO KBA Another great year for you! You owe a decent amount but that is mostly due to gains on trades (which were all long term). Without those trading gains you would have only owed $4k to fed and $3k to MA. You have good retirement distributions going now and social security as well. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount from ZERO due to Vertex options exercises! Your wages went up $210k on those exercises and we used that to increase the cost basis when we reported those trades so that you weren't "double taxed" on that income. The good news is that you are getting good refunds due to making those quarterlies. I have recommended lower quarterlies for the upcoming year of $3,000 federal and $1,000 to MA - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties as you also are getting good investment and social security income. Additionally made sure to file Form 8997 to postpone the $400,000 gain in the QOZ K1. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went away due to no more Vertex options exercises. The good news is that you are getting another good refund due to making those quarterlies. I have recommended lower quarterlies for the upcoming year of $2,000 federal and $500 to MA - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount due to investment income  to prevent tax penalties as you also are getting good investment and social security income. You also had losses on your trades and thus we took $3k of it to reduce regular taxable income and preserved the rest to use going forward.  Finally we again made sure to file Form 8997 to postpone the $400,000 gain in the QOZ K1. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

ANDY MAKE SURE TO SEND OUT KADEN AND MONIKA RETURN (THE ONE WITH KADEN AS FIRST TAXPAYER).... BIG refund this year as you FINALLY get to file jointly!  To be fair, about $8,700 of this refund is due to getting excess social security withholdings back due to his switching jobs.  Still you are looking at healthy refunds going forward I believe.  The rental is still cashflowing great.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity.All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022


p.s. Slight refund this year as you don't get excess excess social security withholdings back due to Kaden switching jobs in 2021. That plus no repairs on your rental made you have a taxable gain of $4,000 there (a good thing but now you have to pay tax on it!) The rental is still cashflowing great a great investment for you I'm jealous!  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity. Another great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Nice refund this year as you got all of your quarterly payments back and then some!  Your wages went up $68k and your withholdings more than kept up.

2021

Very similar result to last year except added 2 rental properties and 1 state! We set the rentals up with all the costs so that we can depreciate them going forward as well as took the current year costs to generate a $12k passive loss that we will also preserve to use in the future to offset future rental income. We also noted your $5k IRA contributions to set up your future Roth conversions. Finally, as noted via email, for last year you have to file Form 8606 for each of you - you can mail that in. Please be sure to do that for the $6,000 amount you contributed to an IRA last year. All that said, you may want to consider doing quarterly payments of $2,500 going forward as you have a small amount of underpayment tax penaties ($87 last year and $73 this year) - if you want to do that automatically I can set that up for you. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Almost exactly the same last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. The new thing that made you owe a bit less was that you had losses in your trades instead of $15k of gains that you had last year - we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. The rentals are cashflowing nicely. We evaluated and decided not to contribute to IRA's this year. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Your income was up a good amount but most importantly you swung from owing to a slight refund thanks to our adjustments - nice! We used the capital loss carry forward from last year to offset income this year. The rentals are cashflowing nicely - VT we were able to offset all income with expenses as usual.  The income on the carriage house was SO AMAZING that we used all the loss carryforward from previous years of $20k to ensure you were only taxed on $1k of this. Finally you decided not to contribute to IRA's this year.

Finally a new thing this year is we are filing a Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for Michael to make sure he is in compliance with that reporting requirement. Everything else looked good.

p.s. Very similar to last year wage income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $53k and your withholdings kept up for a nice refund! We continued to report the tiny bit of business income you had last year and took all available deductions. The new thing was that you exercised and held options after we analyzed different scenarios - this resulted in no extra tax as you were under the AMT tax threshold - nice! We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You owe a good amount due to not having paid enough in quarterlies over the year, but still it's not that bad relative to what it could have been as you made one nice payment.  Your wages went up $21k and your dividends and interest went up $12k - nice!  We reported your business income and took every deduction possible.  You had losses in your trades of $2,041 and we reduced your taxable income by that amount.  Finally we made sure to report your generous gifts to your sons and use your lifetime estate tax exclusion to ensure you owe no tax due to the gifts - great stuff!  Everything else looked good.

2023

Again you owe a little this year due to having no basis in your S Corp - thus the distribution of around $20k you took was taxed as long term capital gain.

All in all, another good year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. You owe a LOT due to a BIG gain on the sale of your rental (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain of $94k is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. We made sure to file in MI to pay taxes owed there and then give you credit in MA for those taxes paid so you weren't double taxed. Finally, made sure to send you a link to book a zoom with me for after tax season to discuss your new real estate venture! Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Very similar to two years ago income and results wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $16k and your withholdings kept up.  You had losses on your trades and we deducted them.  The new thing was mortgage interest - a lot - which led to itemizing and reducing what you owed a good amount - glad we caught that extra mortgage statement. Finally got you that $2k energy tax credit. Everything else looked good.  All in all, another good year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news but it means you are FINALLY getting a refund as you no longer have that Vertex stock component messing things up! Everything else looks good continuing to write off ALL your mortgage interest (LOL) and charity . Let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year results wise - you're getting another decent refund! Your wages went up $18k and your withholdings kept up.  You had gains in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Relay stock but it was only $467 after the bump up in basis. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe due to a BIG gain in your wages of about $60k (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!) - you owe a little but not too much given your income. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity.  You had gains in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Relay stock but it was only $5777 after the bump up in basis and we got to deduct it. All in all, not a bad result for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks! 
Client 322

2022

p.s. Similar to last year results wise - you owe a good amount to federal but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up almost $600k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Alexion which gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. We reported the restricted stock vesting sell to cover trades and increased the basis to properly ensure you didn't pay tax on this amount as you already had paid tax on it through your wages. You had losses in your trades from previous years and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Finally we added back your tax equalization payment to Vertex as a Schedule A itemized deduction called a claim repayment - this lowered your taxes owed by a little more than $9k - nice!

2023

You owe a bit to MA but not too much considering that we had to add almost $90k of untaxed income to your W2.  The reason why is because of your HUGE charity deduction - it's also a deduction in MA this year so you saved 5% on all those contributions in MA as well!  Speaking of which, we made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity on federal as well which is the main reason why you are getting such a good refund there. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went down $38k year over year but your withholdings kept up.  You had some gains on your trades and dividends and that added to the amount owed on our return (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The new thing this year was the sale of your primary residence but we made sure to use the home sale exclusion to exclude all that gain!  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Again very similar to last year income wise but with a slightly decreased amount owed this year - nice! Your wages went up $50k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit less was that you had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Wayfair trades to their proper amounts and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Your wages went up $39k and your withholdings kept up for the most part - you owe but not too much considering your overall income. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Wayfair trades to their proper amounts and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks again!

Hope you are well and enjoying Needham! Lots of new things going on - lots of trades but they were losers from a tax perspective so helped you out tax wise (deducted $3k against regular income). Now that you have a big mortgage you get to itemize and get a big deduction from that. We also got to exclude the almost $500k gain in the sale of your primary residence in Roslindale - HUGE! All in all a great return for you. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Your wages went up $169k and your withholdings kept up BUT the big thing to get you to a refund was making that quarterly payment - nice! It was right in the ballpark and prevent you from having to pay tax penalties. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope to see you on the soccer fields sometime soon!

2023

Your wages were basically the same and your withholdings kept up BUT the big thing to get you to a refund was making that quarterly payment yet again - nice! It was right in the ballpark and prevent you from having to pay tax penalties. We discussed whether or not you would be doing another options exercise - if you do please let me know so we can make a quarterly payment for it.  You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope to see you soon!

Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news (probably due to lower value of stock compensation vesting). That said, it means you have a GREAT refund this year - finally! Based on last year I reduced your automatic quarterlies to $10k per quarter. Everything else looks good preserving the loss on the rental for future years to offset future hopeful rental gains. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $463k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now firmly in the top tax bracket of 37%. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $30k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. This of course assumes that you have a similar year to last year.  
"	Additionally the rental cashflow is improving - still at a loss but getting better. Good job tracking down the renovations! That adds to your cost basis if you ever choose to sell the property so it will lower your gain then.
"	Finally we made sure to increase the cost basis for the Vertex trades but you still had good gains on them (and have to pay tax on them now). Not a bad thing though!
"	·   Start getting ready to pay MA millionaire's tax. Based on your total income of around $1.1MM you would owe MA an additional $4,000.

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your wages went up almost $207k and your withholdings, combined with the automatic quarterlies, kept up to get you to just owing a bit relative to your income - nice!  However being over $1MM in wages made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  You had healthy interest and dividends that increased $13k year over year. You had gains in your stock trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock. 

For the rental, we continued to report the usual revenues and expenses BUT this year you sold it so we had to account for that.  You had a big gain on the sale (partly due to depreciation lowering your cost basis) BUT we also got to take the passive loss of $58k we had been saving for this occasion to wipe out some of that gain.We set you up with quarterlies for both federal based on this year's experience and MA to account for the new MA millionaire's tax.

Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $17,197 by filing jointly to owing a total of $15,057 between both of you, thus saving $2,140 by doing this!  I know this was a bit less that we thought going in so I lowered my fee for this to be $1,250.  That said I increased your normal prep fee for the rental sale (it's complicated) by $250 so basically you ended up in the same place total fees wise (but in actuality saved $250).

On the federal signature pages there is a "Transaction Summary" that shows all payments and refunds where you initial to confirm your bank account. Please IGNORE what it says for MA state as far as what you owe there. This is what you would have owed if we filed jointly. I include this Summary because I think it's important for you to see all your refunds and payments in one place but rest assured the MA numbers are the ones on the signature pages you each sign separately

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and hope all is well!

BIG refund this year as you got all of your extension payment back as well as you would have gotten a $3,000 refund even without it!  Slight trading losses were written off.  I obviously did not set you up with quarterly payments for this year as you are in refund territory now.  Finally, made sure to deduct your rent on your MA tax return.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you got a nice little refund along with a new job! The new thing that made you owe a bit less was that you had good charity which was at a level we were able to deduct. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Your wages were up almost $50k and your withholdings kept up, but still you owe.  It's not that much relative to your overall income.  Your interest and dividends went up to $4k which was great!   We made sure to report the 1099-R and SSA income.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

ANDY PLEASE SEND OUT DAUGHTHER RETURN TORY WHELAN AS WELL AND SEND HER SIGNATURE PAGE TO PARENT AND LINK TO JOB - CALL ME IF QUESTIONS You had a lot going on last year! We fully excluded the gain on the sale of your previous residence which saved you a LOT in taxes! You had big gains on your invstment income - specifically from Hebron K1 but it was long term so taxed favorably. The partnership paid taxes for you in CT so that is why you are getting a refund there and we made sure to get your credit in MA for taxes paid to CT. I set you up with $7,500 quarterlies based on last year - let me know if you'd like me to have those paid automatically and I can set that up. Finally, set up Tory's return and she owes a little to MA due to her investment income - have that set up to come out of your bank account as well. Let me know if any questions - thanks again!

2022

p.s. Your wages went down almost in half but your withholdings still didn't keep up - this is most likely due to being a high earner two wage family with some good investment income. The bad news is that my system calculated tax penalties (aka interest) of $766. I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $9,500 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Upon discussion you decided not to do it which is fine - just be prepared to pay next tax season! Everything else looked good as we accounted for all your K1s and other investment income. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went down by about $43k but in addition Sam got a 1099-NEC from ElasticSearch for $93k which we had to treat as business income.  We made sure to take all possible business deductions to reduce that taxable income as well as max out your SEP IRA contribution (make sure to put $17,424 into a SEP IRA with LPL Financial right now) to give you an extra deduction to get you an extra $6k refund right now.  But unfortunately this still added to your tax burden even though we tried our best to figure out if it was previously taxed.  

You continue to have great investment income - it went up almost $28k last year to $64k.  We made sure to factor in the unemployment income received as well. Everything else looked good as we accounted for all your K1s. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Well Jamie - great refunds and we put the electric car in BUT you made very little money last year (compared to your normal years) and thus the EV tax credit only gave you $46 in credit as it's not refundable - it just wipes out any taxes you might owe in the current year! And unfortunately you can't carry it forward to next year. So it's a good thing you did for the environment but anyways just wanted to let you know that. Everything else looked good. Can't wait to see you this summer hopefully you're coming up sometime soon!

You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income thanks to the quarterlies which really worked out great!  Your wages went up $32k and your withholdings kept up.  We reported all your Salesforce trades and made sure to increase the cost basis to make sure you weren't double taxed.  You still had some gains after that but they were all long term, which means it is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  I increased your quarterlies to $3,000 per quarter to reflect this year.  Everything else looked good.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. You're getting a great refund now that a full year's worth of mortgage interest is kicking in so we can ramp back the quarterlies. Your wages went up $36k and your withholdings kept up.

Your income was down just slightly but your withholdings stayed almost level so the amount you owed to the federal government went down by almost $6,000.

You owe a good amount this year because you had $1.75MM of options income and $66k of restricted stock income vesting to Lindsay's Moderna W2!  This was withheld at the standard 22% rate for most of it whereas you are squarely in the top 37% tax bracket so this was underwithheld by a good amount.  Nothing you can do about it - just letting you know why you owe.  Everything else looks good - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Wages came WAY down after that epic Moderna payout and now you swing back to a good refund! Mike's business is doing better - revenues are up and expenses are down so moving close to breakeven.

You owe a LOT due to BIG gains on your stock shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate except for a small amount that is taxed at short term capital gains rates.  We excluded the gain on the home sale in RI - that's tax free gain of about $340k! Congrats on the transfer and hope you're enjoying California - glad you don't have to do that commute anymore.

Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news but it means you are back to a slight refund this year! Your trading gains were nearly all long term capital gains.  You got the full $6k child tax credit.  You have less mortgage interest (a good thing) which means you take the standard deduction now instead of itemize as the standard deduction is higher than your state and real estate tax paid (capped at $10,000) and mortgage interest combined.  You did great with the dependent care account in maxxing it out and getting the Vertex match - however because Lindsay had no income the $5k was taxable.  We put the K1s from your megamansion off the coast of MA in as well.  All in all a great year - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages went up $117k and your withholdings kept up for the most part. The new thing that ALMOST made you owe a bit more was that you sold your main residence - we used the home sale exclusion of $500,000 to eliminate the $445k gain on the sale of your home - nice! You continue to have gains in your trades even after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock but still that's a good problem to have. We added the rental property and it had a loss after depreciation but still it looks like it's doing well.Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went up $549k (holy Vertex stock price!) and your withholdings didn't keep up  as you are firmly in the top tax bracket of 37% and all that stock vesting of $686k is withheld at 22%. In addition to that you had an ADDITIONAL $106k in capital gains on your stock sales (mostly Vertex).  The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you are a MA millionaire!  This added $3k to your MA tax bill.  The rental property continues along at the same pace. Everything else looked good. We set you up with a voucher to pay $35k to the feds and discussed how you have to mail it in.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and next year let's get this done earlier and then wait on the K1!

p.s. Wage income is way up! Business income is way down! The business loss combined with good withholdings got you a great refund!

Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

You owe a good amount of money but it's all because of that 1099-R distribution of $20k with no federal tax withholdings.  Without it you would have only owed $262.  Still there were no tax penalties.  I gave you blank quarterlies just in case you want them again in case you do another distribution like this year.  Please let me know if you have any questions and hope you're doing good!

BIG increase in your wages last year due to options exercises of $263,000 is the reason why you owe this year.  Slight losses in your options trades last year but I made sure to adjust for proper cost basis so that you aren't double taxed.  Everything else looks good we wrote off the trading losses against regular income and are deducting your taxes (up to $10k limit) and charity. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages include $162k of restricted stock which is withheld at 22% but you have income in the 35-37% tax bracket and thus are underwithheld a bit. It's a good problem to have so hopefully you are prepared for it and you are with the quarterly payments! You also had $172k of gains on your trades even after adjusting the cost basis to be correct - this was all taxed at long term rates which is the best possible.  Finally we took the charity deduction for you to allow you to itemize and save even more money. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

You got a slight refund due to a MASSIVE tax credit from your EV car purchase - nice! Your wages were up a good amount as well as Dan's business income being up slightly year over year too. We got you $1,600 credit for dependent care expenses as well. Set up the rental for you and made sure to take all expenses towards it. Finally, made sure to note that Dan made an extra $2,750k contribution to his Roth IRA. Given your level of income you shouldn't contribute to a Roth or regular IRA during the year - at the end of the year I can tell you how much you can contribute. That way you avoid the hassle of pulling funds out at the end of the year. Finally, I bumped up quarterlies for you. The reason you had a refund this year was because of the EV tax credit and that won't apply this year. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. A big bonus and big withholdings leads to a big refund! Your wages went up $171k and your withholdings more than kept up. The new thing that helped out was starting to build a studio for Dan's business - we capitalized this and will use this as a deduction in the future. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We also deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Finally Dan needs to put $4,638 into a SEP IRA by April 18th - that is the maximum he can do and it is marked in the return.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Nice refunds again!  Your wages went down $140k and your withholdings combined with the quarterlies more than kept up. The thing that continues to help out was builing a studio for Dan's business - we capitalized the new expenses this year and will use this as a deduction in the future.  This year it was a $5k deduction! You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($443) to offset income. We also deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! The rental made great income but also had some expenses so netted out to zero taxable income.  Finally Dan needs to put $1,773 into a SEP IRA by April 17th - that is the maximum he can do and it is marked in the return.  Everything else looked good.

Your wage income is up significantly from last year but the excess social security withholdings we got back with the tax filing ($3,432) reduced what you owe to be about $3k less than last year. There was also some unemployment income in here that drove your taxes up. Cordelia was a nice $2,000 child tax credit for you! Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $17k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that was a bit weird is you set aside more than the $5,000 max for dependent care expenses - the excess of $1,635 was taxed and shows up in Box 1e of the 1040. You should fix that going forward so that it only does $5k to a dependent care account (just for the record the $5k was not taxed). You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Very similar to last year in nearly all respects - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $78k and your withholdings kept up but not as much as last year.

You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.

Slightly lower wages this year but good gains from trades and capital gain distributions as well as some good interest and dividends leads to you owing a bit this year. We made sure to make Jane's IRA conversion to a Roth be non-taxable, and per your instructions we are reporting the excess 401k contribution this year so we don't have to amend in 2022. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Similar to last year income wise  - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income and much less thanks to the quarterlies!  The quarterlies prevented you from paying interest and penalties so glad we are keeping that up. Your wages went up $99 and your withholdings didn't keep up as much as we would have liked due to Vertex restricted stock withholdings being at 22% and some ESPP gains of $3k (which have no tax withholdings but still you got the money it's there to help you pay the taxes!).  We made sure to note the IRA contributions on your tax return as well. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Your wages went up $99 and your withholdings didn't keep up as much as we would have liked due to Vertex restricted stock withholdings being at 22% and some ESPP gains of $3k (which have no tax withholdings but still you got the money it's there to help you pay the taxes!).  We made sure to note the IRA contributions on your tax return as well. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021

You owe a bit due to a MASSIVE increase in your wages (a good thing of course!).  Your withholdings kept up for the most part and I don't think it's worrisome that you owe this amount given your overall income.  You did very well with the dependent care account - excluded $5k of income from taxation and in addition got a $2,200 dependent care credit.  That, as well as the child tax credit of $4,000, gave you some great benefits.  Please reach out to me when you get details of your ESPP plan. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. As discussed on the phone, you owe a big amount due to a big increase in your wages due to $800k of restricted stock vesting. The sell to cover for that is done at 22% and the tax brackets that you are mostly in are the 35-37% and that differential times $800,000 is about $100k (and the reason you owe).   Please reach out to me when you decide what to do as far as payment and let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

What a difference a year makes!  You are getting a good refund thanks to some nice withholdings on your wages. We also made sure to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you.  You had losses on your trades - we used the maximum deduction of $3k to offset regular income and preserved the rest for the future.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2021
Great amount of long term capital gains! We used short term capital losses to reduce them to about $100k but still it was a big enough gain to result in why you owe federal and MA what you owe. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you are still getting a refund even with the increase in wages. Your wages went up $81k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that there were wages withheld for Canada and we had to report them as income as the US taxes worldwide income. There is no corresponding foreign tax credit as you will be getting a refund. Next year we will have to do the same thing but we will have to wait for the Canadian tax return to be done so that we can make sure to report BOTH the Canadian wages as well as the corresponding foreign tax credit so you don't get double taxed on those wages. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT this was the year of getting you tax credits! Your wages went up $3k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit LESS (in the US at least) was that there were wages and taxes paid for Canada and we had to report them as income as the US taxes worldwide income. This year there is acorresponding foreign tax credit and you got both federal and provincial taxes back to the tune of $3,147. Additional credits were $900 for the EV charging station and $2k in energy efficiency tax credits.  We made sure to increase the cost basis of your Xenon exercise and sell immediately options so you weren't double taxed.  .We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and year 2 of Canada taxes complete!

p.s. More dividends (about $7,000 more) equals a bit more owed. But still - good to be making more money. Everything else very similar to last year. Hope you are doing well!!!
Client 345 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

Wages up about $125k last year and your withholdings kept up.  Nicole's business income was cut in half but that makes sense as she only worked half the year.  Everything else looks good we are deducting your mortgage interest and charity.  Your refund was "short" an extra $3k because you got it upfront during the year as advance child tax credit payments.  Let me know if any questions - thanks and hope to see you around soon!

2022

p.s. Exact same to last year wage income wise - but an even better refund! The new thing that made you get a bit more was that Elle's business swung to a loss which you got to deduct. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! You got $5,400 in child tax credits and we made sure to file your Wisconsin return to get you money back there as well. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Again exact same to last year wage income wise - and another great refund!  Between all the states and the federal government your total refund is $16,602 - you should work with your lawyers to divide this up as you see fit.   We reported Elle's business income which swung to a gain of $8k nice!  We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We made sure to file your NJ return to get you money back there as well. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 346

2021

As discussed, you owe a good amount but at least we know where it's all coming from and why! The losses on the sell to cover trades were about $14.5k - we were able to use $3k of it to reduce your taxable income and we are preserving the remaining $11.5k as losses to offset future gains (if any). Finally, you are getting a slight refund from MA because we paid everything owed to them with the extension. Let me know if any questions - pleasure working with you and again thanks for all your help in the past - much appreciated.

2022

p.s. An even better result than we expected! Your wages were down a lot but you still owe a decent amount. That said, it's $9,425 lower because we used ALL the AMT tax credits we had due to previous ISO exercise and holds to lower your regular taxable income this year! The reason we were able to do that (vs. our original projection) was because you sold the ISO's within the same year you exercised them so there was no "bargain element" income for AMT tax purposes this year.  Additionally as planned through the trades you have a big loss carryforward - it's about $460k right now. Hopefully the UI Path stock price comes up and we'll be able to use that to offset future capital gains. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Your wages were down again (about $70k) and you still owe a decent amount. You had a massive gain on your previous ISO exercise and holds BUT we were able to offset it with the loss carryforwards (a nice tax asset) so you paid no tax on them and still have about $310k left to go.  I adjusted your AMT cost basis on those ISO trades as well but we used all the AMT tax credits last year so no benefit to that for you - that's ok though as you got all that money back last year.  Finally made sure to deduct your mortgage interest a nice deduction for you and set up your inaugural Schedule C business return - hopefully a fruitful endeavor for you.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.  


Client 347 - Married Filing Jointly

Wages were up almost $100k but the quarterly payments did their job to keep you owing minimally (compared to your income) and avoiding any tax penalties. I increased the automatic quarterly payments to reflect your new tax situation this year. Accounted for the nanny properly and made sure to include the quarterly payments paid on her behalf to the IRS. Everything else was the same and looks good - let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2022

p.s. Very similar to two years ago income wise - with the big difference you're getting a big refund! Leaving Vertex and their stock vesting has made your withholdings more stable and thus I have dialed back the quarterlies for you this year to $11,000 per quarter - you stated you would make manual payments as needed. Your wages went down $88k but your withholdings kept up. We made sure to note your $5k HSA contribution and deduct it. Additionally got you a $350 energy tax credit. We also made sure to report the nanny as well as all the tax payments made to the IRS on your behalf. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Wages were down about $200k but with no quarterly payments to reduce your taxes owed you end up owing right now. We made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a good deduction for you. Accounted for the nanny properly and made sure to include the quarterly payments paid on her behalf to the IRS. We advised you on your upcoming home sale.  Finally we produced a Married Filing Separately analysis as per your request so you could see what you would have owed if you filed separately.   Everything else was the same and looks good - let me know if any questions - thanks.
Client 348 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. The reason why you owe is because we continue to spread out your retirement distribution of $20k from 2020 over 3 years (next year will be the final year) so $6,667 is taxable from that this year. Your wages went up $42k and your withholdings kept up. Nice gains on your trades all taxed as short term capital gains. As discussed your rental had a loss this year but still the mortgage interest expense came down significantly! Got an extra $2k child tax credit for your daughter congrats again! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Basically the same writeup as last year except throwing yet another kid and rental property at the situation! Very similar to last year wage wise. This is the last year we have to continue to spread out your retirement distribution of $20k from 2020 over 3 years so $6,667 is taxable from that this year. Your rental in Charlestown had a loss again but rent went up well and we set up your new rental (and made sure to allocate interest and real estate taxes paid properly). We took all your mortgage points as a deduction as is your right. Finally got an extra $2k child tax credit for Mihalo congrats again up to $10k in child tax credits! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Basically the same writeup as last year except only one sidejob?  You're slacking!  Your wages were up $53k and your withholdings kept up. No more $6,667 taxable from 2020 retirement distribution nice!  Your rental in Charlestown had a loss again but the new rental is making a nice profit! And of course you got those $10k in child tax credits! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021
Lots of new income but all at long term capital gains rates and all below the top tax bracket so the capital gains tax rate didn't bump up to 20% on any of it! Everything else very similar to last year. Congrats again on the new house! Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Dividends came down, but that makes sense because you sold a lot of stock in the previous year. You still had some gains on a trade and so that became taxable. We converted 47 Spring to a full rental and thus your depreciation and expenses increased significantly, giving you a loss that we were able to deduct against your other income. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope you are enjoying the new place!

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  This year you sold your rental and, as we predicted, you owe a LOT due to a great gain on it!  However we made sure to get you the home sale exclusion for the time you lived there to exclude almost $50k from taxation.  We had to recapture the depreciation which was an expense for you as well as the capital gain on the property - this calculation can be seen on Form 4797 if you would like to look.  

Additionally we made sure to report your business income and take all possible deductions against it.  Finally since you are paying via check we set up payment vouchers for you - please be sure to mail via REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED to ensure you have proof that you mailed it on time AND that they received it.

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of preparing your personal return this year as it was "quite intense" so to speak - next year it will go back to normal.  Thanks and talk soon!

2021

You had some good wages last year, as well as some nice gains on your trades. It was a good move to convert all your IRA's to a Roth and we made sure to make $12,000 of it non-taxable due to prior year's basis from contributions. You had $1,909 in excess social security withholdings due to switching jobs which you got back with this filing. Finally, glad to see you are making sure you take excess contributions out of your Roth 401k by April 15th. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. You have an even bigger refund this year as we got you $2.8k of credit for repaying wages this year that you were taxed on in a previous year - nice! You distributed more of your IRA's and we made sure to make $6,000 of it non-taxable due to prior year's basis from contributions. We noted all your other IRA distributions as well (and they were not taxable). Finally, again glad to see you are making sure you take excess contributions out of your Roth 401k by April 18th. Let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

p.s. You owe a little this year as your wages went up almost $6k and your withholdings went down by $3k from last year.  We noted your backdoor Roth contribution of $6,500 and excluded that in the conversion to a Roth.  Last year we noted your $6k contribution and used it to exclude taxation on the $20k IRA conversion giving you an upfront tax break so that $6k is now taxable this year.  As you are now caught up and only converting $6,500 each year there will be no more catchups or taxable contributions going forward. Let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Between that and no quarterly payments explains why you owe this much this year.  We should talk about adjust your withholdings going forward or even better would be to just pay quarterlies automatically - we now know the amount necessary to be paid (about $54k) so I could set up $13,500 quarterlies to be paid automatically for you if you'd like.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.  Finally, sent Rodrigo his return as a single person in a separate link.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022


p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went down a good amount - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $133k and your withholdings didn't keep up - you owe less than last year but this is mostly due to having $24,000 less in capital gains (and we properly reported those problematic trades). Right now I am calculating you owing $1,001 in tax penalties (aka interest) due to you owing a good amount and not having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $10k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. After discussion we are doing $5,000 per quarter - a great start! Finally we reported Rodrigo's Planeta payment as other income and created a single return for Rodrigo. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Nice refunds! As discussed, need to file Hannah separately in MA. Let me know if any questions thanks.

p.s. You owe a decent amount due to a big increase in your wages (almost $60k) - your withholdings kept up but not as much as we would like them to. Your business income almost doubled to $21k - a good thing except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). We split your return to have Hannah only file in MA and she gets a slight refund there. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Glad we got all that confusion sorted out it made your tax owed go down by a lot!  I knew there was a reason I wanted to talk to you face to face!  You still owe a decent amount due to an increase in your wages (almost $35k) - your withholdings kept up but not as much as we would like them to. Still it's in the range we discussed it would be on the zoom.  Your business income almost stayed the same. We reported your home sale and made sure to exclude the entire gain - a nice tax break for you! Thanks again for your well wishes for my mother.  Let me know if any questions - thanks! 
Client 354 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
You owe a good amount due to over $100k gain on your stock sales (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). $31k of it is short term capital gains but the rest of the gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. You have a lot of dividends as well! The sale of your main residence was COMPLETELY excluded due to the $500k home sale exclusion and factoring in your major improvements. We made sure to reflect your move to Maine and thus you are a part year resident in both states and your investment income is properly reflected in each state. Finally, very excited to hear about your move and your new man - couldn't be HAPPIER for you! All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. A very complicated situation resolved itself into a great refund! The two primary reasons are great withholdings on Nikki's job and the fact you got married - so it worked out in more ways than one! You'll see in the separate analysis I will provide that you save almost $10,000 by filing jointly, so good for you! We made sure to report your rentals correctly and with the correct allocations and have saved it so we can use those allocations going forward (and I can share the spreadsheet with you if you'd like). They are cashflowing nicely but after expenses and depreciation are showing a slight loss - we will preserve that so you can use it going forward. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Finally we are filing a Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for Nikki to make sure she is in compliance with that reporting requirement. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

It was great catching up via Zoom (but not catching Covid!).  We made sure to report your rentals correctly through the Zoom call and with the correct allocations. They are cashflowing nicely but after expenses and depreciation are showing loss - we will preserve that so you can use it going forward. You had some gains in your trades but we used the loss carryforward from last year to wipe them out and then we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We also reported Nikki's Canadian retirement income and got her the corresponding foreign tax credit - not as much as we originally thought due to lower taxes being paid in Canada.  We also made sure to get you $30k deduction in Maine on that retirement income.  Let's do a zoom after tax season to plan out this year's distribution - book a time!  Your federal average tax rate is about 15%.  Finally we are filing a Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for Nikki to make sure she is in compliance with that reporting requirement. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 355 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
Quarterly payments plus Chethana's W2 withholdings (previously discussed) led to a MASSIVE refund this year - congrats! Big jump in dividends and capital gain distributions which was great, as well as we are now itemizing as you have a good amount of mortgage interest. Finally, made sure your Roth conversion wasn't taxable. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $141k and your withholdings didn't keep up (they actually went down a good bit which is weird given your increased income) - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through your jobs which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid a quarterly payment at the end of the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $12.5k federal based on this year - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. You had good investment income of about $40k which increased your tax owed as well. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.  

2023

A bit more of a normal return considering what you had going on in the past.  Your wages went down $95k and your withholdings more than kept up (nice job adjusting!).  That said the real thing that gave you a big refund is that we got some of your AMT tax credit from previous years back - to the tune of $7,185 - nice! We also made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity to increase your refunds.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and glad to get you a great result!

Your wages went up $96k and your withholdings kept up but not as much as we would have liked so I have upped your automatic quarterlies to $6,000 this year - let me know if you feel differently and we can discuss. The rental continues along at the same pace. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.

The rental continues along at the same pace - making money but after deductions not taxable for you.

Your wages were down slightly from last year but it's very similar story to last year. Some slight losses on your trades - not necessarily a good thing but we get to use $3k of it to reduce taxable income and carry the rest forward for future years. We made sure that your backdoor Roth conversions were not taxable but please make sure to follow instructions in separate email to mail in Form 8606 for 2020. You might want to consider making quarterly payments - I would suggest somewhere in the $8k to $10k per quarter range. I can set these up to come out of the bank account I have on file for you automatically. Let me know if you want to hear more about that - thanks.

You owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income and especially considering previous years. Your wages went down $69k but your interest income went up about $9k to compensate.  You had losses on your trades after adjusting the cost basis to be correct and we used them to maximum effect - reducing taxable income by $3k and saving the rest for future years. Everything else looked good. We made sure to note your IRS contributions of $6,500 each so that your future backdoor Roth conversions will not be taxable. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on your Yumanity shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. Your alimony is a big deduction which we continue to take and helps reduce the amount you owe. Jane's business income was down slightly year over year but still bringing in good money. We got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to Ken's switching jobs back. Finally, made sure to note that Jane made an extra $7k contribution to her IRA. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Basically the same note as last year! You owe a LOT again due to a MASSIVE gain on your Yumanity and Forma shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. Your alimony is a big deduction which we continue to take and helps reduce the amount you owe. Jane's business income was up $10,000 year over year. Your wages were up over $1.1MM so be prepared to pay the MA millionaire's tax next year! It's an extra 4% on income above $1MM. Another great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your wages went up almost $619k and your withholdings kept up for the most part. This however made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  You had healthy interest and dividends of $23k and business income of $56k from Jane's consulting.  Speaking of Jane's business she contributed $11k to a SEP IRA which reduced your tax owed about $4k. that increased $54k year over year. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the company stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  

We also reported your new rental in England.  We made sure to put the proper cost basis for the property so you get the benefit of depreciation (a tax expense) as well as we have records in case you ever sell it.  After expenses there was no gain this year.  

We told you about Ken's overcontribution to his 401k - unfortunately we were a day too late to catch it.  Please take out the overcontribution with associated earnings as soon as you can and we will follow up to discuss. 

We also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $7223 by filing jointly to getting a REFUND of $12,075, thus saving $19,298 by doing this!

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and hope all is well!

Daniel,
Your return is ready as we discussed. You owe $154,753 on the Federal return and $22,958 on the State return. In 2023 we will plan your tax withdrawals better and should put you on some low level automatic quarterly withdrawals (maybe $20K for Federal and $3K for State with only 3 quarters left now). This way you will also minimize the penalty that will be higher in 2023 than 2022 (due to higher interest rates).
Enjoy your vacation,
Gary.

You had BIG $50k gains in trades which is the reason you owe in MA. Without those gains you would have owed $30k to the federal government so I have doubled your quarterlies to try to account for this. There is also a big increase in wages which probably increased your taxes owed as well. Still you made a good amount of money last year which is always a good thing. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. A bit similar to last year income wise - except this year you are getting a great refund! $9k of it was due to return of excess social security withheld due to Dipali switching jobs. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.The new thing this year was your big gifts to your children - we prepared that return. It has to be mailed in so please make sure to sign, date, and mail it via registered mail, return receipt requested by April 18th. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year income wise - again this year you are getting a great refund due to great quarterlies! We cut them in half based on this to lighten your load during the year - if things continue at the same rate this will stand you in good stead.  You had gains in your trades and we used the loss carryforward from last year to offset them and then the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset regular income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  We continue to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2021

Very similar to last year federal result wise - you get a slight refund but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $108k (probably due to getting married - congrats to you and Shannon!) and your withholdings kept up.  You had $33k of capital gains and $27k of it was taxed as short term capital gains.  Matt had wages taxed in MA so we had to file a non-resident return there.  This created problems on the Maine side as you get credit in Maine for the taxes you pay to MA but the tax credit isn't enough due to MA being at a lower tax rate (basically they are at 5% while Maine is at 7%) so there weren't enough withholdings on that income.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages went down a good amount - about $290k and your withholdings kept up. Not only that you made some quarterly payments which are all coming back to you on the federal side (for ME you owe a bit more still)! We included the first quarter's estimated payments - you most likely did them but if not they will just reduce your refund on the federal side and ask you for a bit more from Maine. You continue to have good investment income. Everything else looked good. You had an eventful year - hope this year is better. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went down a good amount yet again - about $141k and your withholdings more than kept up to give you a really nice refund! We deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a great deduction for you.  You continue to have good investment income. Everything else looked good. Glad to hear you are doing so well and sorry again for the wild goose chase!  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021

Very similar to last year for Pete income wise - his earnings went up $32k and your quarterly payments kept up.  Melissa's business did great as well and would have made $24k but for the $60k business car deduction which we were able to take.  We were able to use the resulting loss to lower your taxable income.  We deducted the 401k contribution of $30k for Pete as well as the self employed health insurance.  The rental really grew in income last year and you are showing a profit on that - nice!  You also got to use it a good deal which is great.   Your mortgage interest went down last year and thus it now make more sense to take the standard deduction since it's higher than your $10k state tax deduction plus mortgage interest plus charity so that's what we did.  Everything else looked good.  All in all, a great year for you and a great result - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

Hi Pete and Melissa,
"	Your Federal return has a refund of $8,273.
"	Your MA return has a refund of $1,806.
"	We have both these payments set up to be direct deposited into a Charles Schwab checking account with a number ending in #2152.
"	Your overall result for federal purposes is similar to 2021 but for MA purposes you are receiving a refund this year because Casner & Edwards elected to pay the MA tax at the partnership level for 2022.
"	If you have any questions, or would like the refunds to be deposited somewhere else, please let us know.
Thanks,
Ryan

2022

p.s. You owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income and the nature of it. Your wages were $458k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are mostly in the 32% to 35% tax brackets. We increased the cost basis for the Vertex trades so you weren't double taxed and reported all your trades and income from Morgan Stanley. Everything else looked good. Congrats again on vesting at Vertex - great accomplishment! Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 366 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

You owe a bit because you got $2,000 of your child tax credit upfront instead of through your tax return and the refinancing lowered your mortgage interest (a good thing) but also lowered your deductions by a bit which means you owe a bit more now. Just so you know next year Shanae won't qualify for the $2k child tax credit so this may be your new tax situation now - owing a couple of thousand come tax time. Let me know if any questions - hope all is well!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had gains in your trades even after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock but it was all long term so it was taxed at the best rate possible. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Glad you made sure you didn't qualify for that EV credit - it's coming back to bite some of my clients from the past now with interest.  Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $42k and your withholdings kept up for the most part.  You owe a bit more due to gains in your trades even after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock but it was all long term so it was taxed at the best rate possible. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 367 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $60k and your withholdings kept up relative to last year.  The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had almost $100k in long term capital gains on your trades (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  That increased what you owe to feds by $22k and MA by $5k.  Finally we reported Traci's business income and took all possible expenses against it.  Martin - none of your out of pocket expenses for work are deductible because you are paid solely as an employee.  I set you up with quarterly payments based on what you owe for the past couple of years - let me know if you want that to be paid automatically and I can get that done for you.  You might want to consider it as right now I have you owing $496 in penalties based on my software's calculation of the underpayment penalty.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $285k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to being in the top tax bracket of 37% with two good earners. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $17,500 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Additionally we reported your foreign bank account and made sure to file the FBAR for you. Finally, you had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope you are enjoying the place in Germany!   

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your wages went up almost $54k and your withholdings combined with the quarterlies were spot on! This however made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  You had healthy interest and dividends that increased $54k year over year. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Finally you bought a new rental property in Germany - we made sure to report it and take every deduction possible - it is showing a loss now which will be preserved to use in the future should you have any gains on this rental. 

We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We are also filing the Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for you to make sure you are in compliance with that reporting requirement. We set you up with quarterlies for both federal and MA to account for the new MA millionaire's tax.


Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $6,079 by filing jointly to getting a combined REFUND of $2,399, thus saving $8,478 by doing this!
On the federal signature pages there is a "Transaction Summary" that shows all payments and refunds where you initial to confirm your bank account. Please IGNORE what it says for MA state as far as what you owe there. This is what you would have owed if we filed jointly. I include this Summary because I think it's important for you to see all your refunds and payments in one place but rest assured the MA numbers are the ones on the signature pages you each sign separately

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and hope all is well!

2021

Very similar to last year income wise except wages went up by $80k - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Very glad you did automatic quarterlies as now the pain isn't that bad!  You had a big gain on the Toast trade but it was long term and had fed tax withholdings so didn't affect how much you owe to the feds (but it is the reason why you owe MA).  The rental is cashflowing nicely and is making a taxable gain even after depreciation but we are using suspended losses from previous rental losses to make sure that it isn't taxable.  Finally I bumped up your automatic quarterlies to $8k per quarter just to reflect this year a bit more accurately.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks!

2022

p.s. Income down a good bit but getting a MASSIVE refund! Very glad you did automatic quarterlies BUT probably no more need now that Su is no longer at Vertex (it was the stock vesting that was really causing pain come tax time). You had some gains on your trades but all long term). The rental is cashflowing nicely but swung to a loss this year due to big repairs..  Finally out of an abundance of caution I brought your automatic quarterlies to $1.5k per quarter just to reflect this year a bit more accurately.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks!

2023

Income up a good bit due to increased wages and investment income. Very glad you did automatic quarterlies last year as it reduced what you owed and made you avoid penalty interest.  The rental continues to cashflow at the same rate but still at a loss this year after depreciation but $10k better than last year due to reduced repairs!  Finally I brought your automatic quarterlies to $3.5k per quarter just to reflect this year a bit more accurately.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks!

Very similar to last year income wise BUT you got the Kia Sorento EV tax credit for $6,857 to give you a nice refund! You had $16k of capital gains distributions (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise BUT no EV tax credit means you are back to owing. It's not too bad though. Noted Tim's $2,500 Roth contribution. Everything else looks good. Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

ANDY THEY HAVE A CHILD MIA MCCARTHY WITH A RETURN PLEASE DO THE CHILD THING FOR THIS RETURN BIG refund this year!  Even though wages were up $45k your withholdings kept up and there was a loss in Stacie's business which we got to use as a deduction.  This year your mortgage interest was lower so it made more sense to take the higher standard deduction of $25,100 so that's what we did.  You got a $2,000 child tax credit (would have gotten $4k but you got $2,000 as an advance child tax credit.  Finally, made sure to create a return for Mia so that she is getting a $351 refund. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are feeling better Stacie - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022
p.s. Another big refund this year! Wages were the same but there was a loss in Stacie's business which we again got to use as a deduction. It's a much smaller one so hopefully Stacie will be back to making money in her business this year. We continue to take the higher standard deduction of $25,900 vs. itemizing You got a $2,500 child tax credit. Let me know if any questions - thanks and talk soon!

2023

Nice refund again this year! It wasn't as big - wages were the same but Stacie's business had a small gain vs. a loss in 2022 so that is why you have a smaller refund.  Still it's a nice one!  We continue to take the higher standard deduction of $27,700 vs. itemizing. Finally, you got a $2,500 child tax credit as well. Let me know if any questions - thanks and make sure you buy those accounting books Stacie!

Very similar to last year except unfortunately not only are you not getting the $2k child tax credit for Cameron but you also have to pay back the $1k advance you got as we previously discussed, which are the reasons why you owe. Still we were able to keep you at head of household status and got you preferred tax treatment from that filing status. Please let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks!

2022

p.s. Congratulations again on your marriage - it's been good for you in more ways than one! Filing jointly has swung Jenn from owing to a nice refund! We claimed Cameron and Sophia in order to get you $2,500 in tax credits. Everything else looked good. Congratulations again and let me know if you have questions!

2023

Sorry for the passing of your father Rick.  It generated some income on your tax return - you had a distribution of $103k - $39k of it was taxable but had good withholdings to help keep you on track and thus you only owe a bit compared to your overall income.  We made sure to report your Social Security as well.  Happy to hear you are going to 15% on the ESPP Jenn - make sure to sell it right away - put a calendar reminder in!  Finally no kids claimed lowered your tax credits by $2,500.  Hope all is well and thanks again!

2021
Again - Congrats on getting married! Everything stays the same when you're getting married EXCEPT the state and local tax deduction is capped at $5k instead of $10k so you lost $5,000 tax deduction because of that. Your wage income was up last year and you had some great gains on your stock trades ($18k of which was short term) which was a good part of the reason why you owe a good amount this year. We made sure that your Roth conversion wasn't taxable, of course. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. BIG refund this year as you filed jointly and saved a ton of money! The benefit of having Michael's lower income combined with Lasair's higher income means much more of Lasair's income is taxed in lower tax brackets, which gives you a big benefit. This benefit overwhelms any potential benefit from filing separately. As previously discussed, we will follow up in late April/May to look to amend 2021 and see if we can get even more money back! Please reach out then at your convenience. Finally Michael will be setting up a SEP IRA to give you an even greater tax refund. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks! 

2023

Another BIG refund this year as you filed jointly again - this year filing jointly saved you over $22k!   The logic remains the same - the benefit of having Michael's lower income combined with Lasair's higher income means much more of Lasair's income is taxed in lower tax brackets, which gives you a big benefit. This benefit overwhelms any potential benefit from filing separately and we provided you a separate report to demonstrate this. 

We made sure to catch Lasair's accidental direct contribution to a Roth and correct that situation.  We have filed Form 8606 to preserve the basis of the regular contribution so that the rollover to a Roth in 2024 will not be taxed.

Michael's business continues to do well - last year it was up almost $33k even after taking all possible business deductions nice!  We have recommended maxing your SEP IRA so you can increase your future retirement income as well as get a good tax break to increase your refund.  You chose to do $10,000 which is a great deduction and almost the full amount possible.

The new addition of Faelan added a $2k tax credit to your federal income tax refund!  Additionally you decided to rent out your old residence.  We made sure to establish the proper depreciation basis for the rental property going forward and to take advantage of all possible deductions to reduce your taxable income from this property to zero.  This is now set up to be done properly in future years as well.

Another great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Bigger refund this year as you finally got to itemize as you are taking a full year's worth of mortgage interest!  Everything else relatively the same - wages slightly up and David's business income slightly down due to more expenses.  We made sure to note your nanny on your return.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $100k (whoa!) and your withholdings kept up but you lost your refund. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that David's business income went up $8k due to smaller expenses. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Back to the land of refunds - nice!  Your wages went up $19k and your withholdings more than kept up. The new thing that made you get a bit more back was that David's business had a loss and we were able to deduct it.

You owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income which went WAY UP!  Your wages went up $190k and your withholdings kept up.  Your business income was the same pretty much after all possible deductions.  The new thing is that we itemized this year due to signficant charity.  Additionally we made sure that you contributed the maximum to your SEP IRA.  Finally, please make sure to take that $7k out of the Roth by tax filing deadline.  Everything else looked good.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Your business swung from a loss to a nice income of $21k after taking out all possible deductions.

You owe a good amount especially when compared to last year due to a MASSIVE jump in your wages due to the Alexion buyout.  Your wages went up more than $3MM and your withholdings just didn't keep up.  Additionally, you had some gains in Etrade through the buyout of existing Alexion shares.  We also reported your sell to cover Astra Zeneca trade for $1.1MM - that neither resulted in a gain nor a loss because it was a sell to cover trade and taxed immediately as wages.  We made sure to preserve previous foreign tax credits as well as got you $1,200 foreign tax credit for taxes you paid on foreign dividends this year.  We also got you the excess social security withheld of $6,609 due to Lori's switching jobs back.  Finally, made sure to file Noah's return as well.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. You owe hardly anything compared to last year - phew! Your wages came down a good deal as there was no more Alexion buyout to pump them up. We made sure to do the FBAR for you and to get you the foreign tax credit that you deserve. Finally, made sure to file Noah's return as well - please make sure to open a custodial Roth for him for $6,000 - a good start to his retirement savings! Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

The results just keep getting better and better!  You owe even less than last year - nice! Your wages went up about $109k and your withholdings kept up. You had $8k worth of gains from your trades - all long term and thus taxed at the lowest possible rate.  We continue to file Form 1116 to get you foreign tax credits on your investment income earned abroad.  Finally, made sure to file Noah's return as well and get him his refunds!

LET ME KNOW IF ANY QUESTIONS THANKS. BORING year for you (tax wise) - things very similar to previous years EXCEPT: 1) Converted Deneen's IRA to a Roth and doing that going forward - nice! 2) Prepaid $8k in taxes (I advise you keep doing this) That means you owe a very manageable $2k especially when considering the refund you got from NJ. All the kids owed $0 on their tax return. Make sure to sign ALL the returns then I can file - thanks!

2022


p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $35k and your withholdings kept up with previous levels - you owe more federally because you didn't make quarterly payments like you did in the previous year (you did $8k total in the previous year). You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Paying for Kendall's tuition was a lot! We made sure to note that you made a 529 distribution for tuition and made all the earnings non-taxable. Finally the NJ refund continues to be nice and almost offsets what you owe to the IRS.

Very similar to last year overall income wise - however you are getting a great refund this year!  Your wages went up $30k and your withholdings kept up.  The new thing that made you get a refund was that your unemployment income went down by $23k and you went from a $5k gain in your rental to a $5k loss there (which you could deduct).   You also got $4k back in dependent care expenses and an additional $1,800 in child tax credit. Please note your refund is about $2k lower than what I stated in April and that's because you got the full stimulus of $4,200 last year (I thought you only got $2,100).  Also we have noted in your return to take the capitalized interest as a deduction if/when you sell your house or in 30 years, whichever comes sooner.  All in all, a great result for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages went up $27k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you get less of a refund was that your rental swung to a taxable gain even after depreciation due to rent increases - nice!  You also got an additional $2,000 in child tax credit. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Your wages went down a bit but your withholdings kept up even considering you had a lot of income from other sources (parental leave). You got less of a refund was that your rental swung to a big gain of $14k even after depreciation due to rent increases - nice!  The new thing that made you get a refund was Zoey!

You owe a decent amount compared to previous years.Your business revenues went way up bringing your business into profits. Unfortunately this also meant you had too much income to qualify for the earned income credit and thus you owe a good amount.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need a payment plan thru the IRS (I can set that up) - hope all is well - thanks!

2021

You are getting a REFUND due to great quarterly payments made! You would have owed a good amount due to a BIG gain ($312k) on the sale of your rental (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. The reason you have such a big gain is because of depreciation recapture - you get a tax break up front on your rental but they track the depreciation and now tax you on it. That said, we also tracked your suspended losses on the rental and used that to offset your gain (that was a $54k offset). We reported your nanny on Schedule H and of course made sure you got credit for the quarterly payments for her. Finally, you are not itemizing this year because your mortgage interest plus taxes paid (capped at $10k) is lower than the standard deduction. All in all, a great year and result for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. No big gain on the rental sale but also no quarterly payments means you swing back to owing. Very similar to two years ago income and results wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $55k and your withholdings kept up with previous levels. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We made sure to report your nanny and get you credit for that. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

A bit less income last year but that meant you are back to getting refunds!  Your wages went down  $154k and your withholdings kept up with previous levels.

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  The reason why you owe is because we continue to spread out your retirement distribution of $56k from 2020 over 3 years (next year will be the final year) so $18,667 is taxable from that this year.  Your wages went up $30k and your withholdings kept up.  The new thing was that you both had businesses - we set those up - they had some slight losses which we used to offset your income.  Finally, we continued to allocated Leo's wage income between NY and MA.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. You owe a little bit less than last year yet nonetheless you still owe. The reason why you owe is the same as previous years - because we continue to spread out your retirement distribution of $56k from 2020 over 3 years (this is the final year) so $18,667 is taxable from that this year. Both of your businesses did better but still had some slight losses which we used to offset your income. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Finally back to the land of refunds!  No more of that pesky retirement distribution of $56k from 2020 being taxed over 3 years so $18,667 of taxable income from that no longer on your return. Both of your businesses had some slight losses which we used to offset your income. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Congrats again on all the great changes!

2022

p.s. Great catching up and great to see you doing so well. And great to see you getting a nice refund too! Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

BIG refund this year as you got the benefit of Yanmei no longer working which brought you into a lower 24% tax bracket (vs 32%).  The rentals still cashflowing nicely but the big gain on Linden was more than offset by the loss on 507R last year so no taxable income from them this year.  We made sure to report your trades and that you weren't double taxed on the trades from Takeda.  Finally you got a $2,000 child tax credit as well as the excess social security withheld due to Mike's switching jobs back.  All in all, a great result for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Your 2021 return is very similar to 2020 - nearly the same amount of wage and capital gain income. All the Biogen trades are reflected in this return. I set quarterly payments for $17,000 per quarter as we discussed (you can see it in the summary letter),

2022

p.s. Massive year income wise - you owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $742k and your withholdings didn't keep up due to the 22% statutory stock vest withholdings and you are squarely in the top tax bracket of 37%. Still no tax penalties were owed due to having paid quarterlies in advance. We have dialed back those quarterlies to $5,000 given your new work situation. We will make sure to get you some credit for the $75,000 signing bonus repayment you had to make to Scholar Rock next year. Finally we are filing a Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for you to make sure you are in compliance with that reporting requirement. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and congrats again on buying a place in England!

2023

Massive gains on your trades this year - you owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income. You would have gotten a refund without the long term gains on your trades - still it's good to have gains!  We made sure you got credit for the $75,000 signing bonus repayment you had to make to Scholar Rock this year - this allowed us to increase your itemized deductions.  We tried to get you credit for your medical expenses paid as well. Finally we are filing a Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for you to make sure you are in compliance with that reporting requirement. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Refunds a bit higher than last year but pretty much right in line. That child tax credit was great for you hope that comes back! I have your tax documents whenever you'd like to pick them up and I can print a hard copy of your tax return for you if you'd like too - just let me know. Hope to see you sledding again at some point!

2022


p.s. As discussed on the phone, you owe a big amount due to a very little federal withholdings on Lynne's salary. Please let me know when you get that resolved - would love to have an official explanation on how that happened. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a bit but nothing when compared to last year.  Another complication this year is the fake unemployment income - hopefully that gets sorted quickly.  We didn't report it as it clearly wasn't income for you.  Everything else looked good - made sure to make your dependent care account non-taxable and get you all the childcare tax credits you deserve.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks!
Client 386

2021
Wages were up a bit last year which is good news. You had losses on your trades so wrote off $3,000 in trading losses against regular income and preserving the rest for future years to offset future hopeful trading gains. You got $1k of your child tax credit in advance which is why you owe that much more compared to last year.  Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Wages were down a bit last year which is bad news financially but it does mean tax wise you owe half of what you owed last year. We set you up with a payment plan for the amount you owed. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2021

I don't have 2020 tax return but this seems like a pretty typical result for you given your other tax returns and makes sense given that there were no trades. We made sure to itemize and deduct all your mortgage interest and charity. Please make sure to book a zoom with me for May so we can go over your stock plan. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $89k and your withholdings kept up. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($350) to offset income.
The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you exercised and held ISO options, but this only added about $1k to your tax bill. We are tracking these credits going forward so we can use them when you eventually sell these shares. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but it went down a lot from last year! Your wages went down $89k and your withholdings kept up.  The new thing that made you owe a bit less was that you got about $1k of an AMT tax credit back this year to reduce your tax bill.  We continue to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you! Finally went over your ISO's that you need to exercise by 4/15 and helped you decide to exercise and hold $40k and immediately sell the remaining $43k.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.
Client 388 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
You don't owe so much due to a significant decrease in wages.  That's not necessarily a good thing but it is now!  No Vertex trades to add to that income (but you did have some other investment income).  Everything else stayed the same.  All in all, a great result for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a bit more but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $13k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 32% tax bracket. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Very similar to last year in nearly all respects - you owe a bit more but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $16k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22%.  The new thing this year that  helped you out is getting a $600 energy tax credit!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope you're looking forward to Vertex retirement!

Wages up slightly.  Zero income for Erin's business so didn't have to do funky home office and saved you some depreciation recapture (home office deduction can only take you to zero taxable business income, not to a loss).  Rental is showing a taxable gain - probably due to reduction in mortgage interest.  Put the straddles in - added to your MASSIVE capital gain carryforwards - hope that portfolio is doing better than your tax return!  You got $4k child tax credit in advance (thanks Uncle Joe!) so that's why you owe a bit more now.  All in all a most satisfactory return - let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. STRONG AND READY TO BURST!
Client 390 - Married Filing Jointly

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year tax wise you continue to owe a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your withholdings on the Commonwealth of MA W2 were very low considering your overall income - $6k over $76k is less than 10%. I have made it so that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you not having paid quarterlies throughout the year BUT they could come back and ask you to pay them interest after we file (let me know if you want me to include the interest but it's around $2,000 - it's better to wait and see what they say sometimes their calculation is lower than mine). Per your feedback, I have turned off this option to include interest. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $ 9,500 for federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties and it's the best way to tackle this problem. Per your feedback, we set this up to happen automatically. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.



2023

Very similar to last year tax wise you continue to owe a good amount - you owe a decent amount again but not too much considering your overall income. There were two things that happened to make you a bit more this year even when factoring in the quarterlies.  The first is your business income went up by $11k.  The second is the K1 - this brought $42k of income into your return.  Without it you would have only owed $7k federal.  Therefore for next year I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $15,500 for federal and $650 for MA - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties and it's the best way to tackle this problem. This assumes K1 income coming in at the same rate as 2023.  Per your feedback, we will discuss manual payments after tax season. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Sasha increasing his withholdings combined with Rachel's tax payments made for a great and easy result come now - nice job!  We made sure to record Rachel's SEP IRA which is maxed out again for a great tax deduction and really turbocharges her retirements savings!  Sasha you are taking your Roth contribution out and putting $6,500 towards a regular IRA to then convert to a Roth which will help your retirement out as well.  Everything else looked good.

Good jump in wages. BIG jump in interest and dividends. Nice increase in Kristie's business income. It all leads to you owing a bit more this year. And according to the W2's, Kristie had $286k and Josh had $292k - if not for the $9k of business income from Kristie Josh would have won!

2022

p.s. More money more taxes! Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $100k and your withholdings kept up with previous levels but not enough to prevent you from owing a good amount. You had no losses or gains in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the options exercise of Josh's company stock and we used the maximum amount of loss from last year ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. If you want to do quarterlies I can set them up to come out automatically - if so just let me know I would suggest $7,500 per quarter. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

More money more PJs more ND football!  Very similar to last year income wise - except this year you actually get a refund due to your monster payment in December nice!  Your wages went up $82k and your withholdings kept up with previous levels but not enough to prevent you from owing a good amount. You had no losses or gains in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the true cost basis of Josh's company stock and we used the maximum amount of loss from last year ($2,582) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Kristi's business income was the same as last year.  Finally excited to set up automatic quarterlies of $10k for you - this is going to make tax time next year a pleasure!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope to see you at a random event again this year! 

Client 393

2021

Higher wages and higher gains on trades combined with no mortgage interest meant you owe a good bit more in federal tax than previous years. Allocated your state income as discussed per your living situation - hopefully MA won't fight it. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a good amount again. Your wages went down $34k and your withholdings kept up (which meant you still owe a good amount). We adjusted the cost basis on your trades to make sure you weren't double taxed. Additionally we reported your partnership and filed the Illinois state return for it. I would recommend that you pay $4,500 quarterlies as with interest rates going up the tax penalties can be steep (this year I am calculating $651 for you). You agreed and so we set them up. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 394 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

Wages were down a bit last year which isn't necessarily the best news but it means you are getting a good refund this year! You had a TON of Vertex trades where we adjusted the cost basis so you wouldn't be double taxed and then used those losses to offset other stock gains.  We continue to itemize and write off your mortgage interest (way to go finding that other statement!).  We got you the excess social security withheld of $8,406 due to Leah's switching jobs back as well as $2k child tax credit as well as $792 for dependent care expenses AS WELL AS making sure your dependent care account wasn't taxed.  Let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. You owe a bit due to the retirement distribution but you got an offset from your excess Social Security withholdings. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and always an adventure!

2023

No retirement distribution this year which means you are back to a refund - nice!  You had some dependent care expenses that you didn't use so we had to tax them so that reduced your refund a bit, but lesson learned for next year!

The new thing that made you get an extra large refund was that you bought an electric vehicle and we made sure to get you the $7,500 tax credit for it. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Very similar yet again to last year income and results wise - nice refund! Your wages went up $23k and your withholdings kept up. No EV tax credit this year for $7.5k so your refund went down by that amount.  We used the maximum amount ($3,000) from last year's loss carry forward to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Finally we added your business and took all available business deductions to reduce your taxable income there to only $69!  Everything else looked good.

We were able to exclude the entire $103k gain on the sale of risQ stock by using the QSBS exclusion, which saved you from paying $25k on the federal level. Not only that, but we excluded half of the QSBS stock gain on the MA level, and were allowed to have the remaining half taxed at 3% instead of 5%. This saved you from paying an additional $4k on the state level. You still owe a large amount but that is due to the sale of your company - congrats! That gain is taxed at long term capital gains rates - the most favorable rate you can get. Finally, realized the $21k loss on Level 11 Analytics LLC and used it to lower your taxable income. I set up the payments to federal and MA to automatically come out of the bank account you gave us on April 18th. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Not similar AT ALL to last year income wise - your income went down a lot to no big capital gains and you are getting a refund! You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We made sure to report your household employee as well as the tax payments you made for him to ensure you got credit for them. We deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you as the Northeastern $50k deduction really helped out! We also created a Schedule E to report your royalty income properly. Finally a new thing this year was your Nights and Dreams partnership - we made sure to input that as well to properly track the passive losses and your investment in it. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Yet another big year income wise. Your wages were up $223k year over year and the rental again had increased cashflow from rents and a reduction in expenses to swing to an even bigger profit even after depreciation! That said, the rental profit isn't taxable because we have been tracking your previous rental losses and have used them to offset this year's rental profit (but this is the last year for that - we only have $1k in carryforward losses left). I provided you with a MFS analysis as well so you can see you save about $4,000 by filling jointly. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

2023

No wages this year as you started your business.  Your business income was $140k after taking all available deductions! We split the rental in half and it showed a slight profit.   We made sure to file using itemized deduction to stay in sync (as the law requires) with Seyido's tax return.  We got you the QBI small business deduction of $26k for your business as well as $2k child tax credit for Violet.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.
Client 402 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

You owe a good amount this year due to a MASSIVE increase in your wages - they went up $130k and your withholdings didn't keep up.  Your marginal tax bracket right now is 35% and the average tax rate you have right now is 26%, but Sankalp's withholdings are coming in at 21% and Priyanka's at just 10% of your wages.  I have suggested quarterly payments which I recommend or you could adjust your withholdings if you don't want to owe so much going forward. The rental is still cashflowing well but we use depreciation to generate a tax loss which we will preserve for the future.  We are also continuing to use $3k of capital losses to reduce regular taxable income.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - hope you are well - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a good amount even considering your overall income. Your wages went up $72k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to low withholdings through your jobs (especially Priya - her withholdings are about 10% of her income) and you are now in the 35% tax bracket. The bad news is that there are tax penalties (aka interest) due to you owing so much now - my software is calculating $1,080 in penalties. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $10k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. You opted not to do them but I am providing you with vouchers just in case you want to at some point. Finally your rental is cashflowing well and doing even better than last year - still at a loss after depreciation though so it doesn't affect your tax return. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.  

2023

Your wage income AGAIN went up a good amount - you owe a good amount even considering your overall income. Your wages went up $322k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to low withholdings through your jobs (but Priya increased her withholdings from about 10% of her income to 22% nice!) and you are now in the 37% tax bracket. The good news is that there are NO tax penalties (aka interest) due to you owing so much now - this is because you paid 110% of last year's taxes due (a safe harbor to avoid penalties).  I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $20k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. You agreed with this recommendation. We used the maximum amount ($3,000) from last year's loss carry forward to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  Finally your rental is cashflowing well but worse than last year due to increased expenses and is still at a loss after depreciation though so it doesn't affect your tax return. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - still getting a little refund nice! Your wages went up $108k (!) and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that Witness started his own music business - we made sure to take all deductions possible and then maxed out his SEP IRA to get even more added benefit. The rental continues to cashflow nicely and made a slight loss but that is including depreciation so it's a cashflow positive property great stuff! You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the IRWD stock and we used the maximum amount ($100) to offset income. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you!Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!


2023

You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $75k (!) and your withholdings kept up. For Witness - music business, we made sure to take all deductions possible and we used the resulting small loss to reduce your taxable income. The rental cash flows declined due to some extensive energy renovations and thus you had a big loss there which we will preserve to use going forward. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the IRWD stock and we used the maximum amount ($382) to offset income. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you! We also got you all the energy tax credits ($3200) that we could! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

You owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. We made sure to file you as single and only kept Lodgen Court as your rental.  This rental continues to have a tax loss which we will preserve for future use.  Your wages went down $94k (due to Senad no longer being on your return) and your withholdings kept up with previous levels. On the stock trades we made sure to find the correct cost basis for Vertex restricted and ESPP stock and also reported the ESPP discount as income properly on your regular return.  You had great gains on your stock trades and they were all long term so taxed at the most favorable tax rate.  Finally we advised you about this ESPP period and the upcoming one.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021

As we discussed you have a material refund on the federal side (approximately $9K). Portion of this refund is due to the fact that we were able to deduct your S corporation losses against the ordinary income. Please make sure in future to have your presentation fees paid to the Hamden Grinding corporation and open a business account for the company. On the state side you owe approximately $5K. This is primarily due to the fact that there was no state tax withdrawn from your retirement plan payment.

2022

p.s. Paula,
Your taxes are very similar to last year's return which makes sense as you didn't have any significant changes from last year. You are getting an approximately $14K refund from the Federal and owe approximately $4K to the State. We will process the payment to MA using your account number on file on April 18, 2023.

p.s. Income down so taxes down a little bit as well. We maxed out your SEP IRA which was a great deduction and a good contribution to your retirement. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Income down so taxes down a good amount as well. Kevin had a business loss which we deducted, as well as the usual loss carryforward from your previous capital trades losses. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You owe a decent amount due to a sale of your share in the S Corporation (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  You had good quarterly payment to take the bite out of most of it.  On the state side, we had to file in a BUNCH of states due to the S Corporation and I made sure that you got credit for taxes paid to those states.  For some of the states you actually got a refund and that is because the corporation paid taxes for you on your behalf with their filing when they did their corporate filing.  We also set up your rental property and took all possible deductions there and the same for your business.  All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s You owe a normal amount - no more significant S Corp income is a good thing come tax time! You had a slight gain in your business Schedule C. You had big losses in the rental - we will preserve them and use them in the future to offset future gains. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Everything else looked good - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Another good normal tax return - nice.  You had no gain in your business Schedule C after using the home office deduction. You again had big losses in the rental - we will preserve them and use them in the future to offset future gains. You had gains in your trades and we used the loss carryforward from last year to offset them and then the maximum amount ($3,000) against income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Everything else looked good - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Another BIG refund this year as you got to write off the loss from Illustrated Verdict again. Wages up a large amount but withholdings kept up. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks! (btw can you get Jillian to call or email me - still need to finish her return)

2022

p.s. Your wages went down a lot - about $286k and your withholdings kept up for the most part but you didn't have big losses through the S Corporation that we could deduct this year and so you are owing a bit. It's actually a good thing if you think about it - you want to be making money in your businesses! Manuel Francis had some healthy income of about $75k but they also had a good Section 179 bonus deprecation deduction of $70k in there so ended up having little impact on your return. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Finally we are filing Dylan's return - please make sure to put $648 into his Roth IRA by April 18th. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well! 

2023

Very similar to last year income and results wise.  Your wages went up a good amount - about $67k and your withholdings kept up but not enough so you are owing a bit. It's actually a good thing if you think about it - you want to be making money in your businesses! Manuel Francis had a loss of about $19k which allowed us to offset some healthy income of about $42k from Illustrated Verdict and $17k from Rolling Greens.  You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Finally we are filing Dylan's return - please make sure to put $3,716 into his Roth IRA by April 18th. And don't forget to put $6,500 into a Roth for Jillian as well!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and talk soon.

ANDY THEY HAVE TWO KIDS RAPHAEL AND FELIX NELSON PLEASE DO THE USUAL KID THING AND SEND THEIR RETURNS AS WELL THANKS BIG refund this year as you got most of your quarterly payments back due to Eva's business income being down by almost $32k.  We took all possible tax deductions on Eva's business return, including the home office deduction.  I obviously brought down your quarterly payments for next year to $5k per quarter.  Finally, please make sure to fund the Roth's for your kids by tax filing deadline.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $28k and your withholdings kept up. Your dividends and capital gains were good yet again. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that Eva's K1 from Sisters Body had $15k in income which is nice but now you need to pay tax on it. Eva's business continues to make money - a bit less than last year but still a good amount. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Very similar to last year income and results wise - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. That said we have set up automatic quarterlies this year so next year come tax time you hopefully won't owe!  Your wages went up $21k and your withholdings kept up for the most part.

p.s. As discussed, good dividend income was offset by your business loss and trading losses and standard deduction to leave you with a slight refund! You don't get any health insurance premiums back because you are below the federal poverty level. I HIGHLY recommend getting a bookkeeper it will change your life for the better! Also please fix the withholdings for the 1099-R from National Financial Services to AZ vs. MA as you live in AZ now. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

You are receiving refunds on both Federal and State tax returns due to having a big loss on your business (to be expected as it's your first year) which we use to reduce your taxable income. You are receiving the child credit. We have also tried to get you qualified for the earned income credit, but your 2019 income is above the threshold and you do not qualify based on the loss in 2021. The additional depreciation items should benefit you this year as well in future years. Hopefully, your business is picking up and please remember to reach when you are making a profit to decide whether you want to pay some estimated taxes this year or pay it all in the beginning of the next year.

2022

p.s. Antoine,
It's great we figured out all items that had to be depreciated at the end and can use them against your business income. This year let's catch up sometime in June/July to figure out what your estimated taxes will be and to pay some amounts upfront. You are getting an almost $5K refund on Federal taxes and owe $2.3K on State taxes.
Thanks,
Gary

ANDY PLEASE SEND RESULT LETTER SEPARATELY SO HE CAN SEE HIS UPCOMING PAYMENTS Set up estimated payments to be set up quarterly automatically - please be prepared for those amounts to come out on those dates! It's on the summary letter we sent separately - please print and keep for your records. Installment agreement for federal is set up as well as we discussed. This year we catch up - next year we DOMINATE! :)

2022

p.s. The story of this year is QUARTERLIES! The automatic quarterlies have really made a difference in your tax owed and now you have no problem in paying. As a matter of fact, you're getting a refund congratulations! Your business income did well again last year - we took all available deductions and maxed out our SEP IRA contribution. Additionally we deducted your charitable contributions as well. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and see you at BNI!
Client 414 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

Similar to last year income wise BUT the composition of your income changed completely!  You have a big suspended loss from your rental due to previous years losses which we accumulated as well as the big renovations you did this year for the sale - we were able to use these losses to almost completely offset Amy's S Corp income (you now only have $987 from the net of those two activities).  The converse of that is you have a long term capital gain on the sale of the rental of $120k but it is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  This capital gain is the reason why you owe in MA (and on federal as well but you have some tax withholdings to offset it there). Another new thing was Raymond's retirement - we made sure that his state pension was not taxed in MA and we reported his social security income as well.All in all, a great result for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. You again had good business income. We made sure to get you the Qualified Business Income deduction again for $18k of a deduction but you still owe a good amount because of your business income and retirement distributions. Your quarterlies were good but not enough - for next year this problem will be solved as we have automatic quarterly payments set up! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and glad that Raymond is feeling better.

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your business income went down a good amount - thus you are getting great refunds due to the AUTOMATIC quarterlies we set up last year nice! I have recommended lower quarterlies for the upcoming year of $4,000 federal and $1,000 MA and you agreed - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.  
Client 415 - Married Filing Jointly

You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $85k(!) and your withholdings kept up.  You got $2,000 child tax credit as well as $3,200 for dependent care credit. Julia's real estate business income was down but that made sense as her retail business took off and had some great earnings!  Given the result this year I'm not recommending quarterlies but if Julia's business continues to grow you should consider making quarterly payments.  Everything else looked good.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well and please review and sign quickly as deadline is around the corner - thanks!.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise except yet again you had yet ANOTHER big jump in earnings - you owe a bit but not at least the damage was tempered by your quarterly payments which were great! Your wages went up $117k and that was a factor in why you owe. If things continue like this (which hopefully they will) I would suggest $7.5k federal and $1,000 MA quarterly payments and have provided vouchers for that.The rental is still doing well and showed just a slight loss after depreciation. The Brook and Main business is up $20k year over year and making solid money, while the real estate business showed a slight loss. We made sure to have the $30k grant be only taxable on federal side. Everything else looked good and was similar to last year. If you have any questions please let me know - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Your income was down but you are back to some nice refunds as you got most of your quarterly payments which is great! Your wages went down $121k and your withholdings kept up. The rental is still doing well and showed just a slight gain after depreciation - we used prior year's losses to make that not taxable. The Brook and Main business is down $38k year over year which is another reason why you had a good refund, while the real estate business continues to show a slight loss. We made sure to have the ERC credit not be taxable. Everything else looked good and was similar to last year. If you have any questions please let me know - thanks and hope all is well!
Client 416 - Married Filing Jointly

Your wages are up a good amount from last year - most likely due to wage increases as well as restricted stock vesting. You owe roughly the same amount as last year although you got there in a different way - last year you had an IRA distribution of $35k of extra income whereas this year most likely underwithholdings on restricted stock vesting as well as reduced mortgage interest deduction on your Schedule A meant you owed. The rentals look great - still cashflowing positively after depreciation. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages are up another $81k from last year and your withholdings kept up but not as much as you would have liked so you owe a bit more. You owe a bit more than last year most likely due to underwithholdings on restricted stock vesting and a bit more dividends and interest income. The rentals continue to look great - still cashflowing positively after depreciation. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a good amount even considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $87k and your withholdings didn't keep up and you owe more than you have in previous years.  You had good investment income of about $15k.  The rentals keep improving - nice!   The IRS interest rates they charge for underpayment penalties are around 8.5% right now (and fluctuate quarterly according to interest rates) so there are tax penalties (aka interest) due to you owing of $744.  I recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $8.5k federal but after discussing your higher wage withholdings as well as Liz having less income this year we agreed to hold off on quarterlies for now.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Nice refunds!  Slight losses in your trades last year when adjusted for proper cost basis so that you aren't double taxed.   Created a Schedule C business return for your Twitch streaming revenue and took all possible deductions against it to make it only slightly taxable.  Everything else looks good we wrote off the trading losses of $366 against regular income and are making sure to deduct your charity as well. Let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022


p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - your refunds went down a little due to gains on your Moderna trades but after bumping up the cost basis on those trades you are still left with a nice little refund! Your wages went down $10k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that your business income DOUBLED - nice! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year in nearly all respects  - your refunds went up a little due to less gains on your Moderna trades but we made sure to bump up the cost basis on those trades (and actually get the trades)! Your wages went up $8k and your withholdings kept up. Your business income stayed level with last year. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 418 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on all of your trades (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is mostly taxed at the short term capital gains rate ($866k of it) vs long term capital gains rate ($56k of it).  Without the trades and your $100k quarterly payment you would have only owed $3k to federal and had a slight refund from MA so your return result is definitely driven by your trades.  Again, this is a good thing except for now when you have to pay taxes on it.  Everything else pretty normal.  All in all, a great year for you - cannot believe how much you made trading - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT no big capital gain - therefore you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $58k and your withholdings kept up. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.
Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

BIG refund this year as you not only got your $4,000 extension payment back but you also got the excess social security withheld of $7,649 due to you both having multiple jobs back.  And, in addition, you had great withholdings on your main jobs as well.  Again you had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  All in all, a great result for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. You owe a good amount due to the Vertex stock vesting - it's a good thing but they don't withhold enough at 22% federal given your income level (this year in the top 37% tax bracket) and thus you owe. You had slight losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount to offset income. We made sure to report your rental income and expenses properly. Finally we set you up with a payment plan for the amount you owe - you should be prepared to owe this amount next year as well given the way Vertex stock is performing if your stock vesting comes in the same way. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Again you owe a good amount due to the Vertex stock vesting - it's a good thing but they don't withhold enough at 22% federal on the restricted stock vesting and options given your income level (this year again in the top 37% tax bracket) and thus you owe a lot. You had gains in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock of about $20k. We made sure to report your rental income and expenses properly. This year we talked and discussed how it's vitally important to pay quarterlies to get ahead of this and we provided you with quarterly payment vouchers - if you can do payments ahead of time it will really help you out come April of next year!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions thanks.

BIG refund this year as even though your wages were up you had good tax withholdings as well as good deductions from your mortgage interest to lower your tax burden.  We also got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to Neil's switching jobs back as well as the child tax credit that you were entitled to.  All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Not the big refund we got last year as there was no switching jobs this year so no excess social security tax withheld coming back to you. Still a very healthy refund. We made sure to account for all your mortgage interest properly (always a tricky thing for some reason!) as well as reported your crypto trades. Everything else similar to last year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

2023

Very nice refund - very similar to last year!  Your wages were up $161k last year and your withholdings more than kept up.  We made sure to account for all your mortgage interest which is a great deduction for you as well as reported your crypto trades.

Youssef and Stephanie,
Great that you got your pension contribution in on time and we are able to efile for you on time! This saved you 32% on the amount of the contribution, as we discussed. In 2023 we will definitely have to do this in advance, so that there is no last minute rush to get the return out of the way. Additionally, we should talk to Stephanie about conversion to an S-Corp, which will be beneficial for your overall taxes.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE review and sign asap as we need to make sure we file on time to avoid significant penalties. Thanks.

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT the composition of your income changed. You owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income and the nature of that income.  You had massive short term capital gains and we used the updated short term capital loss carryforward from your amended 2020 return to offset a good amount of them.  You also had a good amount of long term capital income.  This gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  Your rental income was up slightly year over year due to no repairs and still bringing in good money.  All in all, a great year for you - please review and get back with signatures asap as I am traveling tomorrow - thanks!

Again you had MANY trades and again you made right around $80k in them! $48k of that was long term with the rest being short term. The new thing that made you owe a bit less this year was that you didn't get half of your child tax credit upfront so now that $2,000 reduces what you owe. The rental continues along at the same pace. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and please get back with signatures asap as I am traveling tomorrow - thanks!

Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Your wages went down $277k and your withholdings kept up. You had good investment income from interest and dividends and your partnerships. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Your rentals continue to cashflow nicely as you increase rents and monitor expenses - you are still showing a loss there due to depreciation but that's a non-cash expense and you are getting good income here. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Finally we made sure to report Meagan's IRA contribution. Everything else looked good.

Hi J.J. - I don't know when I will get the tax return, it will be my first time doing this, but from a quick google search, it looks like Taiwanese tax return comes in late April/early May. And, my current salary is much less now; it's about USD $5k/month before tax (which I think the tax rate is about 20% for my income bracket).
Very different to last year income wise - this of course is explained by your move to Taiwan.  You owed a little but not too much due to the fact we were able to deduct your rental losses from your regular income as well as exclude your Taiwanese income from taxation in America due to the foreign earned income exclusion.  We used the physical presence test (you have now been there longer than a year) to have you qualify for it.  Finally, made sure to note that you made a $5k contribution to your Roth IRA.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $25k but you don't owe anything to the federal government as we used the foreign earned income exclusion to make sure you paid no federal taxes on your income in Taiwan. However, you do owe income tax on it in California as you are still a CA resident for tax purposes. The rental property looked good - it is still making a loss but only because of depreciation - otherwise it is cashflowing positively. Finally we made sure to note all your investment income and report it. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went up $15k but you only owe a tiny amount ($5) to the federal government as we used the foreign earned income exclusion to make sure you paid no federal taxes on your income in Taiwan (but you had income from gains in trades as well as your rental property). However, you do owe income tax on it in California as you are still a CA resident for tax purposes. The rental property looked good - it is now making a gain even after depreciation thanks to a nice raise in the rent - and thus you owe tax to MA on that income as well. Finally we made sure to note all your investment income and report it. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Sorry I know this is some damage but you'll see in the return Doug had some great business and wage income last year and then the gains on the trades result in the amount you owe.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $72k and your business income was up $10k. We provided you with quarterly payment forms which we recommend you try to do this year. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well and thanks for the referral!

2023

Both your wages and business income last year were down income wise - but that means you're getting a nice refund. Your wages went down $127k and your business income was down $29k. We made sure to take every possible deduction against your business income.  Additionally because you were below $400k in income you were allowed to get the Qualified Business Income deduction which was another $15k deduction (basically 20% of your business income). We booked your Freeline loss trades and used the maximum $3k loss against your income and preserved the rest to use going forward.  Finally you decided to contribute $4k to Doug's SEP IRA which gave you an even bigger refund! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and glad you got a great result!

BIG refund this year as Garrett finally got to file as an employee!  Large amount of wages with GREAT withholdings is the story here.  Everything else is pretty much the same as last year - rentals are cashflowing well and still itemizing to deduct your personal mortgage interest and charity.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $425k and your withholdings kept up - the thing that made you owe a good amount was the K1 from Morgan and Morgan and not having qualified health coverage hurt you in MA. Your personal rental continues to cashflow nicely and the partnership rentals look good as well. Katie's business continued to make money and we took every deduction we had available to us to reduce taxable income. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We provided quarterlies to you based on last year's income but if Morgan and Morgan doesn't give you a K1 with income like last year's and you have qualified health coverage in MA there will be no need for them. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Income up compared to last year but everything else remained similar to 2020. Thus you owe a bit as we discussed. Let me know if any questions thanks.

2022

p.s. All's well that ends well! Your wages went up almost $600k and your withholdings kept up for the most part. You had healthy interest and dividends that increased $16.5k year over year. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Baxter stock options exercise and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  
The new thing that presented many complications but in the end a GREAT result for you was the exercise of those Baxter stock options. By characterizing that income as wages instead of short term capital gains you saved almost $10,000 between federal and MA taxes. Not only that, by hunting down that W2 and applying the AMAZING federal tax withholdings on that options exercise (they withheld 50% for taxes!) you are basically getting all of those withholdings back - a great result for you!  
We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We are also filing the Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for you to make sure you are in compliance with that reporting requirement. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your wages went up almost $68k and your withholdings kept up for the most part. This however made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  You had healthy interest and dividends that increased $54k year over year. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the company stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  

We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We are also filing the Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for you to make sure you are in compliance with that reporting requirement. We set you up with quarterlies for both federal and MA to account for the new MA millionaire's tax.


Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $47,049 by filing jointly to owing a total of $33,474, thus saving $13,575 by doing this!

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and hope all is well!

Many thanks, JJ, no questions at this time. We'll plan to make the relevant payments to NC state and Federal by April 19th, as well as send you the K-1 form as soon as received in late March/Early April, and then will sign the returns for e-filing once the K-1 form is incorporated. Otherwise, we will send you a check for the $950 tax prep fee this weekend. Please let us know if there are any other details we should attend to at this time. Much appreciated!

ANDY NO BILL JUST SEND RETURNS AND SIGNATURES THANKS MONSTER year for you income wise due to the options exercises! The big one where you made $540,000 (exercised 64,510 options at 1.20 and sold at 9.60) is the main reason why you owe so much - there was no withholdings on that trade. The other trades also had withholdings but not at the level they should have been (automatic withholding for trades is at 22% but you were in top tax bracket of 37% for most of your income).

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $462k and your withholdings didn't keep up, leaving you owing a bit with some tax penalties owed this year. We made sure to extend to account for the K1 properly. We also made sure to account for the extra income received from KINETICOS LIFE SCIENCES LLC. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went up $73k from last year and your withholdings, combined with your quarterly payments, kept up for the most part. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that your interest income went up by almost $10k - nice!  Another new thing - we made sure to account for the exercise of your incentive stock options - what was great about this is that you don't owe any extra taxes due to alternative minimum tax on these since the "bargain element" was minimal - a nice move for you and now you can convert those gains to long term capital gains with favorable tax rates! 

Of course we again extended your return to wait for the K1 from TCR FFV Fund I LLC and now we are able to finalize and get you the slight refunds you are due. Finally we are providing you with quarterly payment vouchers for the 2024 tax year based on 2023 - please make the one for $28,000 immediately so that you are caught up and then there are two $14,000 payments due in September 2024 and January 2025. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.
Client 433 

2021
Previously discussed why you owe so much this year. We set the payment date for April 18th for the account we have on file for you. Regarding the K1 investment, it's not a deduction - it's like buying a stock - if you eventually sell it the cost basis for the sale will be $100,000. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $766k from last year (which was a big year) and your withholdings kept up for the most part. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had more consulting income - we reported this and took every available deduction against this income. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Of course we extended your return to wait for the K1 from TCR FFV Fund I LLC and now we are able to finalize. Finally we are continuing to file the Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for you to make sure you are in compliance with that reporting requirement. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went up $76k from last year and your withholdings kept up for the most part. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you are no longer reporting mortgage interest and thus using the standard deduction - this was only a reduced deduction of $2k as compared to last year so not a big deal.  You continue to have consulting income - we reported this and took every available deduction against this income. Of course we again extended your return to wait for the K1 from TCR FFV Fund I LLC and now we are able to finalize and get you the slight refunds you are due. Finally we are continuing to file the Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR) for you to make sure you are in compliance with that reporting requirement. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 434 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

You would have owed a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on your Ally shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. We were also able to reduce that taxable gain through the donation of MSFT shares as well as realizing your worthless shares loss of $119k from PaperG. We got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to Tina's having 2 jobs back. Finally, made sure to correct your 401k and HSA contributions to stay within the yearly limit. All in all, a great year for you - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owed a little to the feds when we filed the extension but not too much considering your overall income and you are now getting some of it back. Your wages went up $21k and your withholdings and advanced payments kept up. The new thing that would have made you owe a bit more was your QSBS sales - that said we were able to fully exclude them on both the federal and state level for HUGE tax savings (and that is the reason why you are getting a substantial MA tax refund). You had losses in your trades after eliminating the gain on the QSBS stock trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. 
We also made sure to report Tina's business income and took all possible tax deductions we could against that income.  Finally we made sure to properly account for Andrew's HSA. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 
Client 435 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

You owe a good amount this year due to a sizable increase in income and the quarterlies just didn't keep up.  That said you are getting a great refund from MA.  You had an increase in both dividends and gains from trades.  We set the payment date for April 18th for the account we have on file for you.  Regarding the K1 investment, we made sure to report it and record your basis for future use.  Finally, you did great with the dependent care account in contributing $5,000 to it and we made sure it wasn't taxed.	Please let me know if any questions or if you'd like to set up quarterly payments with me if you think this will continue - I can set it up to be taken out of your bank account automatically on the required dates in whatever amount you think is necessary for the upcoming year - thanks.

2022

p.s. Your wages went down $309k and your withholdings and tax payments kept up, leaving you with slight refunds this year. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Alnylam stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. The new thing that made you get a bit more of a refund was that you got credits for your energy improvements and your EV purchase, which got you about $8,500 more back. We deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages went up $75k from last year and your withholdings combined with the quarterly payments kept up for the most part. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was an increase of about $25k in investment income between dividends, interest, and stock trades - this is a good thing of course but you need to pay taxes on it.  You continue to have itemized deductions - however, this year the standard deduction of $27,700 is more than the total of your state income tax and real estate taxes (capped at $10k), mortgage interest and charity and thus we are using the standard deduction.  Finally, as discussed, we are not setting up automatic quarterly payments as you usually pay them based on the sale of your company stock, which you don't necessarily do every quarter. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

ANDY ONLY SEND RETURN Great fed withholdings. You owe in NY because you are in 10.3% NY State tax bracket and the withholdings when it came to that tax bracket were light. Plus due to the business income and investment income. Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you are getting a slight federal refund which we are applying to next year's tax return. You are getting a big NY state tax refund due to the fact that much of your wages in 2022 were in MA and they withheld taxes there, which gave you a tax credit on your NY State tax return.
Your wages went up $321k and your dividends went up $14k from the previous year. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We made sure to report all your partnership income properly. Everything else looked good.

Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up $67k and your withholdings kept up but what really brought you to within striking distance of what you owed were your quarterly payments - nice job!  The new thing that made you owe a bit less was deducting mortgage interest which gave you a bit of an extra break.  We made sure to exclude the gain on the sale of your home - a HUGE tax break for you!  We also got you a good energy tax credit of $791.  Finally there were losses on your trades and we made sure to deduct them.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

New list below.  Right now you owe $32k to feds but getting $60k back from NY - that includes the income estimate from GTAM.  Let me know as things come in and we can finalize (or extend if need be).  Thanks. We were spot on with the extensions - getting slight refunds from both fed and state. I originally projected the state refund to be bigger but didn't factor in the NYC taxes - the extension didn't factor that in for some reason. Once that is factored in you end up with a slight refund in NY state. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks. Any interest or dividends or stock trades last year from? Still need Mondelez if you have it. Will follow up.  Still need to wait for final K1's from GTAM TS Investment. Agreed. I gave you estimate sheet.  Goldentree Reinvestment Vehicle. Agreed.  Delos Living LLC. Agreed.

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with challenges!  Your wages went down almost $213k due to not getting a big bonus at Cushman like 2022.  Your interest and dividends were the same.  We made sure to report your rental in CT and take all the deductions you deserve.  

For your K1 investment in Baldwin, we were able to use the rental losses to reduce the rental income from that investment.  The excess distributions received of $1,860 were taxed, however, as you have no basis in the investment as you have already received all your original capital back.  

We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you!  You also got $2k in tax credits for each of your 3 children - nice!  Everything else looked good and glad to see you get another great refund.  Thanks and hope all is well!

2021

Similar to last year income wise except your capital gains went up significantly - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income.  Your wages went up to around $18k and your dividends were great again - in the $40k range.  You had $211k in capital gains - only $29k of it was short term capital gains, so you got favorable tax treatment on the rest.  We were also able to take advantage of the $500k home sale exclusion to exclude all the gain on your home sale, which saved you about $150k of taxes when factoring in MA as well.  Finally, we split the state returns so that it reflects your move to Florida.  No more state tax payments!  Great result - hope you are enjoying Florida - let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Nice refund! You owe only $213 in taxes after getting a $1,500 tax credit for education expenses and $799 for credit for foreign taxes paid, which is miniscule when factoring in that you had about $75k of adjusted gross income last year. Your wages were up by $18k while your dividends held steady. No big capital gains which kept your dividends in a good tax bracket. Similar to last year income wise except your capital gains went up significantly - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward the rest for use in future years. Another great result - batten down the hatches for the next storm coming your way! Let me know if any questions - thanks

2023

Much like 2021, your capital gains went up significantly again from 2022 but it was nearly all long term and we used your $16k capital loss carryforward from 2022 to reduce the gains as much as possible.  Your wages went up around $21k and your dividends were great again - in the $55k range which was up $15k from 2022.  You had $328k in capital gains - only $10k of it was short term capital gains, so you got favorable tax treatment on the rest.  We made sure to account for all your K1s and hopefully next year we finally get to realize the accumulated losses on Dancing Plover.  Great working with you again - hope your parents finally get to move in next to you soon.  Let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owed a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $342k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that helped you out a little is that we took a $5k loss from the closure of your investment in Touchstone Capital Partners Fund II. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your wages went down almost $884k due to the tumult in the market. Additionally, you had significant losses in your FRB stock which we captured and will make sure to use going forward as we can as a deduction and to reduce future capital gains.

You still has income above $1MM and thus were subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  You had healthy interest and dividends that increased $13k year over year. The losses in your trades were deducted to the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from a refund of $14,806 by filing jointly to a total refund of $19,743, thus saving $4,937 by doing this!

We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and hope all is well!

p.s. You're getting an overall refund of $41,937 between federal and states. Very similar to last year income wise - you owed a little but not too much considering your overall income and you are now getting refunds everywhere due to the extension payments we made in April. Your wages went up $101k from last year. We reported your business income and took every possible deduction against it. You had $535k of long term capital gains which are taxed at the lowest possible rate - this was largely due to selling Vertex stock you held since 2016. Additionally we were able to utilize $52k of built up passive losses on your partnership investments to offset $52k of section 1231 long term capital gains - a nice tax savings for you!
We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity as well as your investment interest expense which is a great deduction for you! Finally per the calculation of Form 2210 you owed a little bit of interest ($1,045) to the IRS for not paying enough in quarterlies during the year. We have increased the quarterly payments this year to take care of this. Additionally I have credited you this amount on this year's invoice. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You are getting some nice refunds this year from NY and the feds!  We made sure to report your rental as per usual.  The new thing this year was we reported the losses on your two new businesses - this allowed you to get a good deduction which helped out your refund.  We talked about your business returns and next year we can do them for you - just need the financial information on them sometime in late January/early February so we can make sure we get them done by the March 15th deadline.  Hope you are doing well down in Cartagena!  Talk soon.

2021

You had good wage and business income - your withholdings, quarterly payments, and extension payments put you right in line to owe minimally once we file.  The amounts due will come out immediately once we file.  

2022

p.s. Very similar to last year wage income wise - you owed a little but not too much considering your overall income. Our projection when we extended was spot on so you are due to get a couple of hundred dollars back in refunds from federal and MA. Your business income was down $77k but between quarterly payments and business expense deductions we minimized the amount that you owed. We continue to report your K1 investments and added 3 new ones which you invested in this year. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Last year once again both your wage income and business income went up - you owe a little to federal but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages were up $12k and your business income was up $117k.  We made sure to take every deduction possible for your business as well as split the income between FL and MA as well as report as part year tax residents in MA (the final year of state taxes!).  

A new thing this year was deducting mortgage interest on your new place.  In addition we provided you with Form 8822 to mail into the IRS to report your change of address.  Finally, we continue to report your K1 investments properly. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owed a little when we extended but not too much considering your overall income. Your business income went up $7k and your investment income (gains on trades and interest/dividends) went down $2k. The new thing that we will fully account for next year is the final K1 of Turtle Swamp Brewing but we made sure to note the losses for it this year to track it for next year. We continue to deduct all possible business expenses we can for you. Please make sure to continue paying your quarterlies. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Again similar to last year income wise except this year your quarterlies were pretty much spot on and thus you owed nothing when we extended your tax return. Your business income went down $17k and your investment income (gains on trades and interest/dividends) also went down $6k.   Again - we discussed it and we will fully account for the final loss next year with the final K1 of Turtle Swamp Brewing but we made sure to note the losses for it this year to track it for next year. We continue to deduct all possible business expenses we can for you. Please make sure to continue paying your quarterlies. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2021

This is the first year without wage income for your return and your business income dropped almost in half so the amount owed dropped a good bit. Very similar to last year dividend wise - capital gains were up by $60k but nearly all of that was long term capital gains taxed at the most favorable rate. Everything else looked good.  Regarding the trust, good investment income as usual. The bill you received reflects the cost of both returns. Please let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks.

2022

Your wages were $654k and your withholdings kept up for the most part - the reason why you owe is due to business and dividend income. The new thing that made you owe a bit less this year was that you had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Additionally we made sure to use the correct cost basis for the Vertex shares you inherited. You got a refund of your excess social security withheld due to having 2 jobs last year. For your consulting, we used every possible business expense deduction, as well as maxing out your SEP IRA contribution for an extra $4k deduction. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your wages dropped to $195k and your withholdings more than kept up for the most part allowing you to get back your quarterly payment and then some.  You again had good business and dividend income. The business in particular was up $35k.  For your consulting, we used every possible business expense deduction, as well as maxing out your SEP IRA contribution and deducting your health insurance as well. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well! 
Client 451 - Married Filing Jointly

2021

You owed a large amount in 2021 but that was due to the sale of your company - congrats! That gain is taxed at long term capital gains rates - the most favorable rate you can get. We used the stock charitable contributions and your mortgage interest to lower your taxable income. Finally, realized the $21k loss on Level 11 Analytics LLC and used it to lower your taxable income as well. Your gift tax return must be paper filed - I will send you instructions on how to do so in a separate email. I set up the refunds to federal and MA to automatically enter the bank account you gave us. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. You made a lot less last year as compared to the previous year due to no big company stock sales - a return to "somewhat normal", if you will! Your wages went up $197k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you owe a bit more was that you had a huge increase in dividends and interest from $10k to $130k which makes sense given the influx of capital you received. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We also made sure to make your $155k roth rollover from Millenium Trust non-taxable since you put it directly into another one once you received the funds. Finally we prepared gift tax returns to reflect your 529 superfunding gifts to Miles and Leah - we will have to file these gift tax return both this year and the next four years in order for us to spread the gifts out over five years and ensure you don't pay any gift tax on it. We have it noted in your tax return to continue to do this going forward. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

You made a good amount more than last year as compared to the previous year as you had another "normal" year.   Your wages went up $168k and your withholdings kept up. You had another year of great dividends and interest income and they went up about $10k.  We made sure to make the interest and dividends from government entities non-taxable where appropriate both in federal and MA.  You had gains in your trades of about $28k and we used your loss carryforward of $750k to offset them and then used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest ($about $720k) for use in future years (a good thing as you have more capital gains coming nice!).

 We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We also made sure to make your $10k in charity deductible in MA (a new deduction there). You received $3.8k in foreign tax credits and $2k in energy efficiency tax credits.  We also made sure to report everything necessary for your nanny and all your partnership investments.  

Finally there is no need to file gift tax returns this year as you didn't give anything to your children (I know I told you last year that we would have to but they changed the rules for 529 superfunding so this is no longer necessary).  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks! 
Client 452 - Married Filing Jointly

2021
You owe a decent amount but much less than last year due to great wages and good business income from both of you. We took all possible deductions on your business income. There were losses on your trades which we also deducted. Tim is putting the maximum of $24,978 towards his SEP IRA which is another great deduction. We got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to Meghan's switching jobs. Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity. I obviously brought up your quarterly payments for next year to $11k per quarter to reflect the current situation - let me know if you would like to pay that automatically and I can set that up. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

2022

p.s. MASSIVE jump compared to last year income wise - you owed a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $778k and your withholdings kept up for the most part but still when making that much money you just didn't have enough tax payments. That said, we paid what was due during the extension. We also took care of allocating your income between MA and PA and of course paying Philadelphia their local tax (this return needs to be paper filed - be sure to mail it in with payment!) Additionally we allocated all your many trades (which resulted in a loss of $17k overall) between MA and PA. We also used the home sale exclusion to exclude about $126k of gains from the sale of your home - this left about $23k to be taxed after partially excluding the gain but due to your losses on your trades you only ended up paying taxes on $6k of it). Tim had a good year in his business again which contributed to both your income and the amount owed. We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Finally please make sure to have your company withhold taxes this year in PA and Philadelphia - very important to avoid owing a lot to them next year! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

BIG decrease compared to last year income wise - but now you hardly owe anything federally (the state story to come later!). Your wages went down $502k and your withholdings kept up. We again took care of allocating your income between MA and PA (should be for the last time!).  This year we have to file everything PA related by mail.  I have sent you all the requisite paperwork and addresses.  Please make sure to sign and date all returns and mail them via registered mail, return receipt requested.  The resulting allocation between MA and PA made all your MA income reported on Meghan's W2 non-taxable so you will get $21k back there - nice!  However you do owe a good amount to PA and Philadelphia but hopefully this is the last year for that.  We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! We made sure to report all Tim's business activities.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

You have a slight federal refund from where we projected - without the extra mortgage interest deduction we just found you basically would have broken even. Let's look to adjust your withholdings after tax season - can you set up an appointment so we can talk sometime in late April to May timeframe? Please let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks!

p.s. A BIG increase when compared to last year income wise - you owed a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $96k and your withholdings generally kept up. You had a big increase in dividends to $6,411. The new thing that made you owe a good bit more was that you had a great investment with a big long term capital gain with no withholdings - you had to pay tax on it but you paid it at the lowest possible tax rate. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

A BIG DEcrease when compared to last year income wise - AND now you have a slight refund nice!  We made sure to report your family leave and waited for your K1 (not the one from last year doh!).  Finally congrats on Chloe she got you $2k child tax credit!  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. You ended up owing a little bit more in taxes (about $8k) now due to the K1 from Winnibit coming in with about $20k more in income than we assumed at tax extension time. We have calculated interest owed to the IRS due to owing so much at tax time (the IRS is a pay as you go system so they charge interest) - please recognize this is not exact so they may send you a notice asking for an additional amount but we don't anticipate it being a lot.
 We continue to file in CA due to Karen having taxable wages there from Meta during the year. This generated a slight refund of $1 which will be directly deposited into your bank account.
The K1 from Winnibit generated the vast amount of your taxable income this year. The news was good here though all things considered - the $2,064,630 of capital gains reported were all long term which is taxed at the most favorable rate possible. Additionally we were able to use about $2k of capital losses to offset those gains. Finally there was a HUGE charitable contribution through the K1 of $225k which, when combined with your $10k tax deduction and $17k mortgage interest deduction, generated a $255k tax deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

You ended up owing a little bit more in federal taxes (about $2k) now due to my software calculating a little bit more interest owed. We have calculated interest owed to the IRS due to owing so much at tax time (the IRS is a pay as you go system so they charge interest) - please recognize this is not exact so they may send you a notice asking for an additional amount but we don't anticipate it being a lot.  The good news is that there is a new charitable tax deduction in MA this year so we were able to deduct the charity from Winnibit in MA and thus generate a $3k tax refund there for you.

 We continue to file in CA due to Karen having taxable wages there from Meta during the year. This generated a slight refund of $6 which will be directly deposited into your bank account.
The K1 from Winnibit generated about half of your taxable income this year. The news was good here though all things considered - the $492k of capital gains reported were all long term which is taxed at the most favorable rate possible. Additionally we were able to use about $2k of capital losses to offset those gains. Finally there was a nice charitable contribution through the K1 of $67k which, when combined with your$3k of other charity, $10k tax deduction and $21k mortgage interest deduction, generated a $101k tax deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

Another great year in your business - an increase in business income of $78,000 combined with a maximum contribution to your SEP IRA and good charity as well as a good payment at extension time led to a slight refund.

p.s.  Very similar to two years ago result wise - you owe no taxes in both federal and AZ and thus are getting a full refund of your withholdings! The sale of your rental made things much smoother this year but we are still filing in NJ due to the partnership income there (you are getting a slight refund there because we paid $75 to them with the extension). Your dividends went up $22k but they were nearly all "qualified" dividends which gets taxed at 0% interest rate when you are in the 10% tax bracket (it's a special break) and thus the reason why you don't owe federal tax. We continue to report your farm revenue and deduct all possible expenses for it.Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.  

2023

Never a dull moment tax wise - another year with some new challenges!  Your dividends went up another $20k to be more than $67k. We continue to report your farm revenue and deduct all possible expenses for it - this year your revenue climbed a lot but your expenses went up about the same amount leaving you with the same amount of loss (more or less) as 2022.  Ted's business did well and made $12k after expenses.  We continue to report your K1s in NJ for a little bit of regular income.


Speaking of which, these investments were sold for $160,000.  We made sure to report these as long term capital gains with the cost basis we have been tracking for these investments of $15.5k for SFO and $21.6k for Kimball.  This reduced the gain somewhat.  What really helped out though is your big capital loss carryforward from past years - we used ALL of it and thus reduced a $108k gain to $40k.  This gain was also reported in NJ and of course now you get to pay taxes there for quite possibly the last time (sad for our home state!).

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and talk soon!

All's well that ends well - ending up with about $346k back between federal and state when all is done. A couple of notes: 1) Gift tax returns - don't forget to mail them in! 2) Trust return - we can efile - it's a pass through return to your personal so you don't owe anything - very simple 3) Personal tax return - we adjusted the long term capital gains by doing a "Section 1061 adjustment" - you can see this on Forms 8949 and the summary is on Schedule D. You can see this on pages 17-20 of the pdf. 4) Illinois has zero tax owed or refunded - perfect return! 5) Using UBS account ending in 844 for refunds and payments - let me know if you need me to change it. Please let me know if you have any questions on this or anything else - sending returns now - thanks.

You owed a decent amount due to your business income (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). That said, the extension payments were sufficient to cover this so you are getting a refund. We made sure to note that you are contributing the maximum amount to your SEP IRA which is a great deduction. All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

You owed a decent amount due to your business income (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). That said, the extension payments were almost sufficient to cover this so you are only owing a little bit (and we included calculations on interest and penalties on this to the best of our abilities). We made sure to note that you are contributing the maximum amount to your SEP IRA which is a great deduction - glad we were able to get it in for you on the last day.

Income was down a lot this year due to the state of the markets but the good news is you now have a great refund!  We reported your two rentals and took every deduction possible (except insurance since so close to the deadline and didn't hear back from your insurance agent) - they are cashflowing nicely but after expenses and depreciation you don't have taxable income from them.  We also made sure to deduct your home mortgage interest.  Finally reported your F & Gold and recorded it in your return as well.  All in all a nice result for you - hope all is well with you - let me know if you have any questions thanks!

As discussed, set up payment plan for remainder after you pay the $4k on April 19th. The payment plan has to be approved but I'm sure it will be. See you at BNI!

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a good amount and would highly suggest you start paying quarterly tax payments as you make good income, which is a good thing! We set you up with a payment plan as we discussed but please review to make sure everything is to your liking. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Hi Henry,
p.s. Great meeting you via Zoom and nice refunds! Pleasure - talk soon.

Very similar to last year income wise - you are getting a nice refund again!  Your wages went down $18k and your withholdings kept up.  The rental had a bit more expenses so had some more losses which we will suspend and take in the future when more income comes in.  The businesses did a bit better than last year but still had losses which is ok come tax time as they are losses we can use to offset regular wage income.  We itemized to take advantage of your mortgage interest and charity.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Hi Rachel,
p.s. Very similar to past year's returns - your income went up by about $30k but your withholdings held up. You had some slight gains on your Vertex trades. We split your mortgage interest and real estate taxes with Todd. Finally, gave you background on Vertex and all the good stock stuff there! Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Nice refund especially given your income!  Your wages went up $50k due to a big increase in Vertex stock price making your restricted stock vesting much more valuable (a good thing of course even if you have to pay taxes on it!).  You have losses on your trades after we adjusted the cost basis to make sure you weren't double taxed on your Vertex shares.  We continue to split your mortgage with Todd for a nice deduction.  Finally, made sure to note that both of you made an extra $6.5k contribution to your IRAs and rolled them over to your Roth IRA.   Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Hi Deborah,
p.s. You had a good year income wise and did well with the quarterly payments but you owe a little bit because you had significant capital gains on your estate distribution as well as you didn't get the recovery rebate credit of $1,400 this year that you got last year (that was a one time COVID thing). Everything else looked good - set you up with quarterlies for this year as well. The final thing I would mention in case you haven't done it yet is to make sure to adjust withholdings on your retirement distributions to take out MA taxes - you should call your retirement plan places to make sure that they are doing that. Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

The slightest of refunds from both federal and MA - almost the "perfect" returns (which is neither owing or getting a refund). Your wages went down $6k and your withholdings kept up.

p.s. Nice refund! Without the claim repayment (deducted on Schedule A) you would have only gotten a $600 refund. Obviously we deducted your mortgage interest and taxes as well. We made sure to exclude all the gain from the sale of your home in NJ. We prepared a Schedule C to report the slight profit on your Ebay Sales. Finally, we made sure to file in both NJ and MA and report all income properly to each state. Please let us know if any questions - thanks.

The new thing was the home sale but we got it so you weren't taxed on any of that gain (sorry again for the confusion). We reported your nanny on Schedule H and gave you credit for the quarterly payments of her employment taxes. We also reported Martha's business income and took all possible deductions against that income. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Very similar to last year income wise - your wages again went up around $24k and your withholdings kept up. The new thing was Abram!  But also Martha no longer having a side business but Andrew did have one.  We used the home office deduction to its greatest effect.  We also reported your nanny on Schedule H and gave you credit for the quarterly payments of her employment taxes.

The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. Assuming things stay similar to 2022 I have set you up with quarterly payments of $5,000 to federal and $500 to MA to be paid automatically out of the bank account we have on file for you.

2022
p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a good amount even considering your overall income. Your wages went up $75k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through your companies which gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket. You had significant dividend income which we reported. The good news (tax wise) is that the losses from your trades - we were able to use them to offset $6k of capital gain distributions from your investments, another $3k to offset regular income, and the rest to carry forward to use in future years. I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $8,500 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Nice refunds! Your quarterly payments stood you in good stead. Wages were high and dividend and trade income were good, as well as your business income. We took all possible deductions we could against that income. For the upcoming year, it's a good idea to make estimated payments even though Tica is retiring as you have good wage and investment income. That said, I have "dialed it back" to $5k for federal and $1k for MA for each quarter. Hope all is well and glad to hear Mike is recovering - let me know if you have any questions - thanks.

2023

Again a nice little federal refund and you only owe a little to MA. Your quarterly payments that you made stood you in good stead well done! Wages went down by about $50k but your withholdings kept up.  Your business income went down by $20k as well after we took all possible deductions we could against that income. For the upcoming year, it's again a good idea to make estimated payments even though Tica is retiring as you have good wage and investment income. That said, I have again "dialed it back" to $1.5k for federal and $250 for MA for each quarter. Finally added the foreign bank account to your return for FBAR and tax return purposes - it is Form 8938 should you want to take a look.

p.s. Your wage income was up a lot last year - nearly $67k. Fortunately the withholdings kept up and you're owing less than last year. We made sure to properly increase the cost basis on your Vertex trade. You had losses in your trades so we used the amount ($317) to offset income. Let's talk in last week of April about everything Vertex! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

2023

You owe a bit due to a BIG gain in your wages (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  Your wages went up $67k and your withholdings mostly kept up, but not as much as we would have liked. Your wages include $58,000 of restricted stock which is withheld at 22% but you have income in the 32% tax bracket and thus are underwithheld a bit. It's a good problem to have so hopefully you are prepared for it. The ESPP did well you made $6,500 from it and hopefully even more after my recent advice. You had losses on your trades after adjusting the cost basis to be correct and we used them to maximum effect.  Finally we reported your Live nation income a nice boost for you! I have recommended quarterlies of $2,500 - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties and you agreed to do so.  All in all, another great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a good amount. Your wages went up $76k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due partially to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the tax bracket of 35%. It's also due to the big capital gains of about $93k (nearly all long term). We excluded the gain on your home sale which was nice! Finally, we allocated the rental properly so that it's set up going forward.     The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) BUT I would suggest you pay quarterlies throughout next year. I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $6,000 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties as last year you owed $22k with no stock gains. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.  

2023

Again similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount yet again - you owe a good amount but the automatic quarterlies brought that down and helped you avoid penalty interest. Your wages went up $118k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due partially to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the top tax bracket of 37%. It's also due to the big capital gains of about $63k (nearly all long term). We also got you the $2k energy tax credit for your energy upgrades to your home.  Finally, the rental properly is doing great - nearly breakeven if you take out depreciation which is great.  I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $11,000 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties just as it did this year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $50k and your withholdings mostly kept up. The new thing I would suggest might help out in the future is making $3,000 quarterlies - if this year is like last year that will stand you in good stead come tax time next year (and help you avoid tax penalties - I'm calculating you owe $186 in penalties right now). If you'd like to make those payments automatically through your bank account let me know and I can set that up. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years (and preserved the losses from last year as well). Created a business return for Robin and took every possible deduction we could against that income.  Finally, got Bharat to take out his excess contribution and included that in this year's tax return so we don't have to amend when we get the $1,500 1099-R distribution form next year. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Again very similar to last year income wise - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $10k but your withholdings didn't keep up relative to last year. The new thing I have suggested is making $4,500 quarterlies - if this year is like last year that will stand you in good stead come tax time next year (and help you avoid tax penalties - I'm calculating you owe $437 in penalties right now). You chose not to do so as you make more through your investments. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years (and preserved the losses from last year as well). Robin's business remained profitable and we took every possible deduction we could against that income.  Your rental is cashflowing very nicely - way to increase that rent!  Finally, we don't have to amend 2022 for the $1,500 1099-R distribution form you got with code P as we already included it as income last year. Everything else looked good.

You got an extra $4k child tax credit as well as a refund of $1,284 for excess social security withholdings due to having more than one job during the year - nice! Finally, we made sure to take your charity and mortgage interest to its full extent possible - a nice deduction for you. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Your income went up a LOT from last year - your wages went up $331k and your investment income went up almost $80k - nice!  The new thing this year was a K1 for Lauren from Friars Head - we made sure to get the tax basis correct so we can account for this investment properly going forward, as well as create a NY return for this investment.  We of course made sure you weren't double taxed on this in MA (as you paid taxes on this income in NY).  Like last year we are providing you payment vouchers for NY based on this year's experience.  Finally, we again made sure to take your charity and mortgage interest to its full extent possible - a nice deduction for you. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

P.S.  FYI - We increased your invoice $250 from last year to account for the extra work involved with the K1 and preparing an extra state tax return.

Your wages went down $24k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we have discussed before gets withheld at lower rates than the tax bracket you are in. I recommended quarterlies last year of $2,500 federal but you decided against it which is fine it's just now is the time to pay what is owed. Let me know if you want me to set up quarterlies.  Finally, your rental property had a big loss again - we will be preserving that loss for the future to use against future income and capital gains should you ever sell your property. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Great refunds! We took the maximum possible deduction for the losses on your trades last year. Additionally informed you your employer is withholding at 5.9% in MA - unusual but leads to your big refund there. Discussed your options and advised you on best course of action there. All in all a great year for you - congratulations on the home purchase - talk to you soon!

p.s. You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. The new thing that we dealt with this year was the exercise of your options - because you exercised and held while the price of the stock was at market value there are no gains and thus no taxes owed. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $59k and your withholdings kept up with last year's levels but still wasn't enough as right now my software is calculating you owe $1,763 in tax penalties (basically interest) for being underwithheld.   I have recommended automatic quarterlies for the upcoming year of $12,000 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went down a good amount - however that means you are getting a GREAT refund!  Your wages went down $294k and your withholdings with the quarterlies kept up .  The good news is that due to you having paid quarterlies throughout the year you are getting a big refund back.  I have recommended lower quarterlies for the upcoming year of $6k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Finally congrats on the new house - we got you the full deduction for the mortgage points paid up front and also excluded ALL the gain on the sale of your old home!  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Low federal withholdings (which you planned on) resulted in you owing a lot in federal taxes. When you start at Moderna I would advise against this as there would be tax penalties incurred because of this (the government may ask you for a bit of interest on this return just so you know at some point after we file). Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and looking forward to discussing Moderna stock with you after tax season when you start there.

2023

p.s. We recognized more than $12k in ESPP gains on the sale of your Moderna stock as we have to include the discount from market price when bought to purchase price as wages when sold if it is a disqualifying disposition (basically sold in less than 18 months from purchase date).  The price of Moderna went down a lot from when you bought it on June 1 and thus you have a big loss on the trade (which we captured appropriately) and you can use that as a loss carryforward going forward.  I would advise against transferring ESPP stock (and as a matter of fact it's a good idea to treat it as a short term savings vehicle and sell immediately as you are taking risk by holding as you can see by what Moderna's stock price did). Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Your wage income was up a lot last year - nearly $140k. Fortunately the withholdings kept up and you're still in line for a refund. We made sure to properly increase the cost basis on all of your Sarepta trades. You had losses in your trades so we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Nice job on the ISO exercises - there was minimum bargain element from the exercises so you weren't subject to AMT. We are tracking them so that we can properly account for the cost basis for them if/when you sell them in the future. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

 
Client 490

p.s. Made sure to note your 1042-S forms - they make you have to paper file so a good idea to fix that with the Canadian bank. Also noted all your Vertex trades with the proper cost basis. Make sure to go back and get 2021 amended as you should get some money back there as 99% sure HRB reported those trades wrong. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Your income was up BIG last year and your withholdings kept up for the most part - you owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. We made sure to report the foreign tax credit for the UK earnings and taxes paid on those earnings and in addititon input your past tax credits for the foreign taxes paid to the UK in previous years that we will be able to use in future years if you ever have any foreign income. We also reported Zac's PFML income as well as took the maximum $1,200 dependent care credit for your dependent care expenses. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Very similar to last year in all respects - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. I set your quarterlies for the upcoming year at $1,000 per quarter - it's a little conservative but it won't cause a huge refund if things remain in the same ballpark and gives us some cushion. No need for MA quarterlies your withholdings are good there. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Very similar to last year in all respects - except this year you get a nice little refund! I set your quarterlies for the upcoming year at $1,000 per quarter - again it's a little conservative but it won't cause a huge refund if things remain in the same ballpark and gives us some cushion. No need for MA quarterlies your withholdings are good there. Glad we found that SEI and LPL Financial income to make sure your return was complete.  You had gains in your trades but we used last year's loss carryforwards to offset them and then used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset regular taxable income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Great refunds! Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down about $25k but your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you get a bit more back this year was the arrival of Lucy! An extra $2k child tax credit for her. We made sure that your Roth conversion (and your regular retirement account conversion) wasn't taxed. To be honest, I don't see any need for quarterlies as long as nothing big is changing for the upcoming year as you are getting all of them back and then some! Congrats again - pleasure working with you and will send out a link so we can do a zoom after tax season to talk about Medtronic and anything else you would like. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

You owe a minimal amount just as I predicted last year when I told you no need for quarterly payments nice! Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up about $52k but your withholdings kept up. The new thing that made you get a bit less back this year was that you made more than $400k in taxable income which reduced the $2k child tax credit somewhat.  Still you got some credit there.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

p.s. You owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages include $117,000 of restricted stock which is withheld at 22% but you have a lot of income in the 32-35% tax brackets and thus are underwithheld a bit. It's a good problem to have as I will explain in our Vertex zoom where I explain all things Vertex but it's just something you need to be prepared for. Feel free to book a zoom now if you'd like me to give the Vertex talk before we file. We deducted your mortgage interest a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Meg and Nick,

We are probably a bit higher than what we wanted to owe to Federal and State. You definitely got a great use out of your expenses and I depreciated all the assets over the five years to make sure you receive those deductions in the near future as well. Let's stay in touch for this year to determine how much of estimated payments you need to make. While attached coupons provide you a good reference point, the payments you make will depend on your estimated income this year.

Thanks,

Your wages went down $113k and your withholdings didn't keep up as much as we would like. The good news is that you had great withholdings on your $90k IRA distribution which helped.

p.s. You made some good wages and thus owe a bit this year due to no longer having your soon to be ex spouse on your return. You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($1,500 for married filing separately) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We made sure to itemize as discussed to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Your wages went down $24k but your withholdings more than kept up as you were allowed to use bigger deductions this year - nice!  We filed you as head of household to get you better tax brackets.  Additionally this year we used the maximum amount of $3,000 from your loss carryforward to offset income (last year was $1,500 for married filing separately) and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We also used it to wipe out the $6k you made from the sale of the AZN stock.  We made sure to itemize as discussed to deduct your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you!

Hi Kathleen and Mark,
o	Your Federal return has a balance due of $20,614.
o	Your MA return has a refund of $180.
o	The major reason for the large payment due on your Federal return is the increase in income between 2021 and 2022. Total wages increased $166,122 between 2021 and 2022. 
o	Your 2022 taxable income was $401,949, which is a $153,690 increase over 2021. This resulted in a tax of $87,656 (after applicable credits) which is an increase of $39,858 over 2021. 
o	You had $67,042 in payments for 2022 (including the $6,000 estimated payment), which was only an increase of $1,374 over 2021 when you include the 2021 extension payment.
o	Your organizer indicated that you did not want to make any payments due via direct debit, so we have prepared the return as if you will be paying the Federal balance due via check or online. If you would like to have it direct debited, please let us know. 
Thanks,
Ryan

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise and results wise. You owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages stayed around the same and your withholdings again didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Oracle which gets withheld at 22% and you are now firmly in the 35% tax bracket. Additionally Cris's withholdings are good for herself but when combined with high earnings it adds to what you owe. According to my tax software's calculations there is $630 in tax penalties (aka interest) due to you owing a good amount at the end of the year. I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $8,500 federal and you agreed to do it - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. (Also I reviewed your Oracle trade reporting from 2020 and 2021 and it is correct)

2023

Again similar to last year income wise and results wise EXCEPT this year with the quarterlies you reduced the amount you owed and avoided penalties. You owe a bit but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up by $224k and your withholdings again didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Oracle which gets withheld at 22% and you are now firmly in the top 37% tax bracket. Additionally Cris's withholdings are good for herself but when combined with high earnings it adds to what you owe.  I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $15,000 federal and you agreed - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Finally we made sure to record your respective IRA contributions and to make Cris's Roth conversion non-taxable.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up a good amount and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Moderna which gets withheld at 22% and you are now in the 35% tax bracket. You also had capital gains of $84k (a good thing except now when you have to pay taxes on it). I have recommended higher quarterlies for the upcoming year of $9,500 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. However we decided against it for this year. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Similar to last year income wise EXCEPT what you owe went down a good amount - you owe about $25k this year vs $38k last year. Your wages went up $44k and your withholdings didn't keep up as much as we would have liked - thus you owe now.  In addition this year there is an underpayment penalty of $581 being calculated due to being underwithheld.  They call it a penalty but basically it's charging you interest.  I have again recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $6,500 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  You agreed - a wise choice!  We made sure to report all your K1s and file in NY due to some of them.  Finally you had losses in your trades and we used $3k to offset regular income and will carry the rest forward to use in future years. We increased your price by $200 due to new NY state filing requirement and 5 new K1s added to your return.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went up a good amount - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $82k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased stock compensation through Vertex which as we will discuss at some point gets withheld at 22% and you are now firmly in the 32% tax bracket. The good news is that there are no tax penalties (aka interest) due to you having paid 110% of the previous tax year's amount due through your withholdings. That said, I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $2k federal and we implemented them - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Also setting up quarterlies for April, June, September and January of the following year. Vertex is the gift that keeps on giving!  But don't worry your Fidelity account reflects all the wages I'm sure!  Speaking of Vertex made sure to increase the cost basis on the trades so you weren't double taxed. Everything else looked good.

2022
p.s. Your wages went up $82k from last year and your withholdings weren't enough considering the other things you had going on to keep you from owing a good amount.  The new thing that made you owe a bit more was the sale of your rental property - after accounting for depreciation you had a $49k gain. Offsetting that was the passive rental losses that you had from last year of $29k which was a nice deduction. What really happened though is you got a HUGE refund last year by taking all those passive losses last year and this year they weren't available to help offset this gain. We of course took all available deductions in both your business and the rentals and made sure to capitalized the additional renovations on the property you sold. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and pleasure working with you.

Additionally made sure to put in your loss carryforwards that was a nice deduction for you. I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $2,000 federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

You owe a bit due to a BIG gain in your wages (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  Your wages went up $117k and your withholdings mostly kept up, but not as much as we would have liked. Your investment income also went up $11k to contribute to why you owe now.  We got you $330 back as a credit on the water heater you bought. Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a great deduction for you. Like last year I would recommend quarterlies of $2,500 - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  After discussion on Amazon vesting we agreed $6,00 would be better. All in all, another great year for you - looking forward to our zoom - thanks!

p.s. You owe a good bit less than previous years (when factoring in the fact that you didn't make any upfront payments) but still owe a good amount due partially to good dividend and interest income. I included quarterlies in case you want to consider doing them. I can even set them up to be done automatically through my software - just let me know if you'd like me to do that. I noted Colin's $6k contribution to a regular IRA and am tracking that basis should he ever convert it to a Roth. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. Got you the excess social security of $4,431 back due to Katie switching jobs. Everything else looked good. You owe in NY but are getting credit for taxes paid there in MA. Hope all is well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

We reviewed all the tax documentation you sent us for the QSBS stock sale and did our own research to determine you were able to use the exclusion even in the event of a divorce.  Thus, we were able to exclude the entire $3.815MM gain on the sale of Acquiom stock by using the QSBS exclusion, which saved you from paying $907k on the federal level and $228k to RI. You still owe a little federally but nothing compared to what it could have been - a great tax break for you!  Finally, you are getting a nice refund in RI.  Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks and hope you are enjoying life in RI!

I recommend quarterlies for the upcoming year of $7,500 for federal and we eventually decided on $6,750 - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.

p.s. Your wages were about $275k and your withholdings kept up. The thing that made you owe was the business income for both of you.

Please let me know if any questions - thanks and pleasure working with you this year - looking forward to working with you for years to come!

2023

This year you would have owed about $18k if not for your business income which DOUBLED between the both of you from $15k to $30k and thus made you owe about $26k all in.   Your wages went up $70k and your withholdings didn't keep up relative to the gain in earnings.  Perhaps this was due to the switch in jobs?  We took every deduction and credit we could to reduce your taxable income., but based on the past years, it looks like you will continue to owe come tax filing time EXCEPT now you have set up $6k quarterlies, which will stand you in good stead for next year.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

We deducted your mortgage interest - a nice deduction for you!

You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We made sure to report your K1s and social security properly. The $20,000 SEP contribution was a nice deduction. Finally as interest rates have been going up the penalties for not paying quarterlies have increased substantially. My system is calculating that you owe almost $1,800 in penalties. If you think your income will be the same this year you should use the quarterly payment vouchers I have provided. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You had gains in your trades even after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock which is a good thing and what you ultimately want. We deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Second verse - almost as same as the first!  Very similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went up $30k and your withholdings kept up for the most part. You owe a bit more due to the rental - even after taking all deductions including depreciation you still made $5k nice! You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we deducted them all against regular income. We also deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Made sure to report your Incyte trades correctly so you paid minimal taxes on them. In addition, explained to you why you got a big refund last year and owe this year (you had big medical expenses in 2021). Finally let you know the Incyte trades were wrong in 2021 and if you amend you can get up to $1,800 back between federal and state. If you need help doing this please let me know and we can do it for a reduced rate after tax season. Thanks again - glad to have you on board!

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise but a much different result - nice refund! Your wages went down $35k and your withholdings more than kept up - they went up A LOT compared to last year and thus you have a great refund. You had loss carryforwards in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($2,059) to offset income. We made the IRA distribution non taxable but something we will discuss is Roth conversion for the future. We deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and glad to have you on board! 

2023

You owe a good amount but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages include $574,000 of restricted stock which is withheld at 22% but you have income in the 37% tax bracket and thus are underwithheld a bit. It's a good problem to have so hopefully you are prepared for it.  You will deal with this by making sure to elect higher withholding on the restricted stock vesting.

The rental continues along at the same pace and we are filing in CA to report it.  We made sure to exclude your dependent care account and get you $200 on top of it.  Finally the new thing is you are MA millionaires!  This added $4.5k to your bill in MA.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Client 523 - Married Filing Jointly

p.s. Good thing we are filing on time as you owe some more than last year and would have had to pay interest and penalties if we didn't pay it now. Your wages went up $130k and your withholdings didn't keep up compared to last year. Your dividends were up by about $6k. You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  
You would have owed $12,688 with no extension but since we already filed an extension that payment will come out for $5,000 and the remainder you owe will pull with this filing. In MA you would have gotten a $95 refund but now you will get a $1,095 refund after the state pulls the $1,000 payment on April 18th we were making with the extension. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Very similar to last years return except this year you had a nice $400 gain on your ESPP! It's good we logged into Fidelity to get all that extra income so you didn't get a letter from the IRS.

p.s. You owe a good amount due to the Vertex stock vesting - it's a good thing but they don't withhold enough given your income level and thus you owe. You had gains in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We added back $941 in excess dependent care contributions as taxable income and informed you of the benefits of the Vertex dependent care account. Finally we set you up with a payment plan for the amount you owe - you should be prepared to owe this amount next year as well given the way Vertex stock is performing. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and looking forward to our chat about all things Vertex in the near future!

2023

Very similar to last year tax wise you continue to owe a good amount - you owe a decent amount again but not too much considering your overall income. The main thing that happened to make you a bit more this year was the price of Vertex went up!  Your wages include $142,000 of restricted stock which is withheld at 22% but you have income in the 35% tax bracket and thus are underwithheld a good amount. It's a good problem to have as the stock should be growing in your Fidelity account. Therefore for next year I quarterlies for the upcoming year of $5,000 for federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties and it's the best way to tackle this problem. Per your feedback, we did not set them up. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Nice refund this year again as you got a good tax break due to the startup of Melissa's business. It shows a loss of about $10,000 which is normal for most business startups as they get going and you get to take advantage of that business loss now. We made sure to note the unemployment received as well. Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks and great to be working with you!

p.s. Big increase in income this year compared to last! Your wages almost doubled and your withholdings kept up for the most part. The new thing that almost made you owe a bit more was that ChemMed tried to tax you on $5k of wages you had repaid but we got them to fix that and thus you save about $1,500 because of that. You had some taxable IRA distributions of about $15k. We noted your $6k backdoor Roth IRA contribution and made sure to make it non-taxable. Now that this is done you are able to do the backdoor Roth on a non-taxable basis going forward. Finally, we also made sure to file you in 3 states - LA and RI which you split time in and then MA where you worked. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

p.s. Charlie,

We have started preparing for an S-Corp conversion and disclosed all your business activities on a single schedule C. We took all available deductions we could to reduce your taxable income. We included your HSA contribution of $3,650 for 2022. We noted your SEP IRA contribution of $25,000 as well as your self employment health insurance deduction for the proper amount.  


 Another big difference from last year's return is that real estate loss deductions are not available this year as they cannot be applied against your ordinary income. Last year you had a sale of the rental property and were able to deduct real estate losses against a gain on sale. That said, we noted the sale of your personal residence and made sure that you paid no tax on it as your cost basis was above the sale price.

We have also provided you with quarterly payments for the upcoming year. These payments are based upon last year. You will notice the federal quarterly payments are a bit higher than what you did last year - this is because you had a 2021 federal refund of $40k that you applied to 2022 tax return which lowered your need for quarterly payments for 2022. Since we won't have that this year we have provided you with updated higher federal quarterly payment amounts.

Let's touch base in the next couple of weeks on your home office deduction, planning for the S Corp deduction, and potentially unwrapping your real estate LLC. Pleasure working with you so far - glad we have this set up - next year should be much smoother now that we are familiar with your financials and have your tax situation in our system.

Thanks,
Gary

You owe a little bit due to doing a great job with your quarterly payments.  We have upped them to $3k per quarter and made them happen automatically so you don't have to worry about making them!  You had a loss carryforward on your trades from last year and we made sure to deduct the maximum $3,000 against your income.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest still a great deduction but not as great as we hoped!  Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

We disclosed all of Rishi's business activities on a single schedule C and took all available deductions on that income.  Additionally we made sure to deduct the interest paid on Rishi's partnership loan (congrats again on becoming a partner!) as well as COBRA payments.  Finally, we made sure to max out the SEP contribution available to you which really turbocharged your refund as well as your retirement - nice! We took all available deductions we could to reduce your taxable income. We included your HSA contribution of $3,650 for 2022. We noted your SEP IRA contribution of $25,000 as well as your self employment health insurance deduction for the proper amount.  


 Another big difference from last year's return is that you got married (congrats again to both of you!).  We reported all of Ben's income.  Additionally we made sure to file all requisite state returns due to partnership filings and to get you credit for tax payments made by the partnership on your behalf.

You owe a decent amount but it's not too bad relative to our original scenario analysis as you had higher wage withholdings than we originally had in our projection. We reported your ISO exercise and holds and you paid AMT of about $79k on them (just as we predicted) - hopefully the company continues to grow and this works out! We made sure to report your business income (both regular and partnership) - you got some slight deductions there. Finally - probably the biggest change in your life - Elijah - got you a $2k child tax credit. All in all, a great year for you - - let me know if any questions - thanks!

p.s. Very similar to last year income wise - you owed a little but not too much considering your overall income. Your wages went down $45k and your withholdings kept up with last year's level, so making that $77k estimated federal tax payment in January of 2023 was well merited. We should talk about making a similar payment for the 2023 tax year if you think your income will be in the same place (let's discuss).

You had losses in your trades after bumping up the cost basis for the Vertex stock and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years. We reported all the K1s (6 in total) and made sure to record the basis of these investments as well. Next year we will be able to deduct your mortgage interest since you just bought a place - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2023

Your wages went down $350k and your withholdings kept up with last year's level, so making that $9.5k estimated federal tax payment in January of 2024 was once again both well merited and spot on! We should consider making a similar payment for the 2024 tax year if you think your income will be in the same place (let's discuss).

We made sure to account for all your partnership investments - we made sure to take care of that for you as well as get you credit for tax payments made on your behalf by the partnership to NY and thus you are getting an enhanced refund in NY as well.  As discussed last year, we made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and charity in full this year.  Finally we made sure to note Ben's IRA contribution and make sure his rollover of $6,000 to a Roth was not taxed.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if you have any questions thanks!

p.s. Michael's wages were about $822k and between his withholdings, your payment with the tax filing last year, and the extension payments made in April you are now due a slight refund. We deducted everything possible from Jenna's consulting business and made sure to deduct $18,000 for her contribution to her solo 401k. We also made sure to account for your daycare expenses and make the $4k contributed to a dependent care FSA through Mike's work non-taxable. We also deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Your wages were down a good bit as compared to 2022 but Jenna's business income was up.  Once again between his withholdings and the extension payments made in April you are now due a slight federal refund as our projection made in April was spot on. We deducted everything possible from Jenna's consulting business but this year there will be no contribution to her solo 401k as we discussed. We also made sure to account for your daycare expenses and make the $3,210 contributed to a dependent care FSA through Mike's work non-taxable. We also deducted your mortgage interest and charity - a nice deduction for you! Finally we made sure to wait for your trust K1 report and include that in your tax return.

Wages are down a lot but with that your taxes owed are down a good amount as well. We made sure to claim your daughters as dependents and that you coordinated with John to use itemized deductions to get the best deduction possible.  You had $47k in long term capital gains - we made sure to increase the basis of your Vertex stock trades so that you weren't double taxed on them. Finally made sure to report your nanny properly. Let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

p.s. You owe a little bit (but a LOT less than your previous accountant told you!) due to good gains on your Vertex shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). Your combined wages were $1.169MM and your withholdings, when combined with your extension payment, kept up for the most part. However, you do owe some interest due to having owed past the payment deadline of April 18th so we have calculated that and included that in your return. Please know this is an inexact calculation so the IRS may send you a letter asking for a little more interest, but shouldn't be too far off. We made sure to report your K1 income. Everything else looked good.  

The next step is to review your last 3 years worth of income tax returns - please upload them to me at your earliest convenience, along with the Fidelity statements for both you and Pooja. Hopefully we'll be able to get you a big refund!

Please let me know if you have any questions thanks!

2023

You owed a good amount during the extension filing due to the BIG gains on your partnership investments  (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!) but we estimated accurately then what your final bill would be and thus you are getting some refunds back - nice!  The investments also required us to file in MANY more states than before due to income and tax payments happening in multiple states - we made sure to take care of that for you as well as get you credit for tax payments made on your behalf by the partnership and thus you are getting small refunds in many states as well.   And of course we set it up so that you will pay electronically to the states where you owe so you don't have to pay via check to multiple states - these minimal amounts will come out immediately once we file.  Finally with respect to this we also got you tax credit in MA for the taxes you paid to these respective states so that you aren't double taxed.

Your combined wages were $1.008MM which was down about $161k as compared to last year.  Your capital gains, as previously discussed, were up over $385k!  You had a full year of rental revenue - we made sure to take every deduction possible and reported that properly.  

Once again, you do owe some interest due to having owed past the payment deadline of April 18th so we have calculated that and included that in your return.  However, we reduced this by over $2,000 by filing Form 2210 to report your capital gains received towards the end of last year and thus reduce the interest you owe. Please know this is an inexact calculation so the IRS may send you a letter asking for a little more interest, but shouldn't be too far off. 

Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if you have any questions thanks!

p.s. Nice refunds! You are getting back everything you paid with the extension and then some! The new thing this year that made you owe a bit more was that you converted your former primary residence into a rental. We made sure to capitalize and depreciate the cost of the house as well as the renovation costs. In addition, we deducted every possible expense to get you to the lowest possible amount of taxable income on this property (it was around $400 after all expenses deducted). 

We did not deduct your remaining mortgage interest as it was below the standard deduction of $25,900, so it's financially better for you to take the standard deduction. and charity - a nice deduction for you!  

We made sure to note your IRA contributions and will make sure they are tax free "backdoor Roth" rollovers when we report them next year. 

You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  

Finally, we reported your childcare expenses and made sure that your dependent care account contribution of $4,992 was not taxed (as well as you got an extra $202 tax credit on these).  

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks. 

2023

 Again you got some great refunds! Your wages went up $100k overall and your withholdings kept up.  The new thing this year that made you owe a bit more was that you had a full year rental which made $5k AFTER depreciation and all expenses for you which is great! We deduct your primary residence mortgage interest and charity which was another great deduction for you.  We made sure to note your IRA contributions and made the $25k cumulative distribution a tax free "backdoor Roth" rollover.  You had losses in your trades and we used the maximum amount ($3,000) to offset income and carried forward to rest for use in future years.  Finally, we reported your childcare expenses and made sure that your dependent care account contribution of $4,998 was not taxed.  Everything else looked good.

Wow sounds like you are having a great time! Good job on the estimated payments. The crypto yield notes brought in some good income. We were able to wipe out your rental income with depreciation and by allocating your mortgage interest and real estate taxes and various other expenses. Hope all is well and you are doing good.

2023

BIG refund this year as you got all of your quarterly payments back and then some due to using the home sale exclusion to ensure that the gain on the sale of your former residence wasn't taxed (except for depreciation recapture for the rental).  We took the passive loss accumulated on the rental as a deduction as well as the loss on your partnership.  For the partnership, please make sure to keep track of capital contributions so we can track your basis (as well as of course keep good accounting records).  Finally, we made sure to allocate your income between VT and MA and report properly to each state.

You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on your options for your Moderna shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed as wages on your W2 and then we adjusted the cost basis of the Moderna stock trades so that you don't report gains on those exercises and get double taxed.  The reason why you owe so much is Moderna withholds 22% on options exercise for federal whereas you are heavily into the top tax bracket of 37% - that 15% difference times all of your options income of $1.2MM is the reason why you owe (it's not exact because it's a blended tax bracket rate but you get the idea).  We also added in your rental - it is showing a loss this year and we are preserving that loss to use against future rental income.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!
Client 549

You had much more wage income last year but that was offset by taking the higher itemized deductions (mortgage interest, charity, taxes, etc.) this year as well as getting excess social security withholdings back for having multiple jobs.

You owe a tiny bit because you no longer qualify for the Earned Income Credit due to living abroad for more than half the year and you also got the full stimulus payment of $1,400 so can't get that again.

Your wages were up significantly from last year and unfortunately your wages didn't keep up so you owe a good bit more than last year. We made sure to exclude your dependent care account so that's $5k tax free which is nice. Some slight gains on your trades - always a good thing. You might want to consider making quarterly payments - I would suggest somewhere in the $5k to $7k per quarter range. I can set these up to come out of the bank account I have on file for you automatically. Let me know if you want to hear more about that - thanks.

We forced standard on both of your returns - because max of $5k SALT and mortgage interest only $8k that gets you to $13,800 itemized on one return but only $5k itemized on other - better to take standard of $12,550 on both - standard saves you $1,500 over itemizing. Additionally we gave you full credit of $749 for the solar shades on Justin's return. Finally, we were able to exclude the $2,500 of dependent care account from being taxed. Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

I'm going to send your tax returns to you now. You owe $3,589 to IRS and $806 to MA. The reason you owe is due to the retirement plan withdrawal from Fidelity of $25k - you had to pay income tax on that. Additionally, withdrawing it before age 59 and a half meant you got hit with an extra 10% early withdrawal penalty of $2,500. Without that withdrawal you would have gotten about $4,600 back between federal and MA. Just letting you know why you owe. It's not a big deal - we are going to pay it off with this filing and you'll start all fresh next year!

You owed a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on your Wilson/HCG shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. We took care of paying for this when we filed your extension so you are getting a slight federal refund. However, you owe $5k in MA due to this gain as well as your business income. All in all, a great year for you and I've noted in your tax return for next year the Wilson/HCG shares cost basis. Hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

BIG refund this year again as you got most of your quarterly payments back due to your wages being down a good bit (due to less stock compensation flowing through your W2 for options exercises).  We reported the 2 new K1s as well as all your trades, which showed a slight long term gain after all the capital gain distributions .  You did great with the dependent care account in maxxing out the Vertex match and we made sure it wasn't taxed.   I obviously brought down your automatic quarterly payments for next year to $15k per quarter to reflect the current situation.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest but the refinance led to it being lower this year due to the $750k mortgage cap (the previous mortgage with Citzens was eligible for $1MM mortgage balance as it was originated just before the new tax code rules were passed for mortgages).  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

You owe a good due to a MASSIVE increase in your wage income.  Your wages went up $302k and your withholdings just didn't keep up.  Your business income conversely was down which made sense as you were more focused on working.  We took every possible deduction we could against that income.  The new thing this year is that your mortgage interest went down and thus it now makes more sense to take the higher standard deduction, and so that is what we did.  Finally, we got you the excess social security withheld of $8,854 due to Carl's switching jobs back.  All in all, a great year for you as your income grew greatly - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Very similar to last year income wise except you had yet ANOTHER big jump in earnings - you owe a bit but not at least the damage was tempered by your quarterly payments.  Your wages went up $276k and that was a factor in why you owe.  If things continue like this (which hopefully they will) I would suggest $30k quarterly payments - would you like me to set it up to happen automatically?  Please let me know if you want me to do that before you sign. The rental is still doing well and showed just a slight loss after depreciation.  The reason you owe Maine so much is because both of your salaries are taxed in MA but you reside in Maine - Maine's tax rate quickly hits 7% whereas MA has a flat 5% tax rate so that differential of 2% multiplied by your income adds up quickly.  I would suggest automatic quarterlies of $7,500 for Maine and I can set those up for you as well if you'd like.    Please let me know if you want me to do that before you sign.  Everything else looked good and was similar to last year.  I know you are leaving me next year but I just wanted to say it's been a pleasure working with you over the years and please let me know if you need anything in the future.  And of course if you have any questions please let me know - thanks and hope all is well!

As discussed already, big refund from NY and you owe MA a lot. You'll have to pay MA upfront and hope NY sends you the refund! (They will but hopefully they just do it and don't make you prove that you only worked there for a little bit). Please adjust your state withholdings to be to MA instead of NY as we also discussed. Everything else looks good - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Wages were down last year but besides that your return is similar to previous years EXCEPT you are getting $7,500 EV tax credit as well as $2,200 for dependent care expenses and $3,350 for child tax credit and $300 for energy efficient property so you hardly owe anything to the feds! Rental is still cashflowing nicely. Created Schedule C for your new business. Good investment income. Everything else looks good.

Another great year income wise. We did great with the payments - we overshot a little bit but not by much and better to be safe than sorry. Great job with the rentals they are both cashflowing really nicely even after depreciation they have a taxable gain which is amazing for newly purchased rentals! Please schedule a zoom so we can talk and go over potential quarterly payments for next year and any other questions you may have. Thanks again - talk soon.

You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on your Ebay and Paypal shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!). The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate. The sale of your rental property was a factor as well - you made $160k on that sale after expenses and depreciation was factored in, but we were finally able to realize accumulated passive losses against it for $85k to reduce the tax hit. We made sure to file in CT for Julia's business income there. The sale of your main residence was COMPLETELY excluded due to the $500k home sale exclusion and factoring in your major improvements. Finally, made sure to set you up with your automatic quarterly payments from last year as hopefully this is somewhat of a normal year tax wise! All in all, a great year for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Wages up slightly.  Lisa has a slight gain in her business after taking into account all deductions while Tom's loss wipes that out and is a good tax deduction that we use to offset your wage income.  You have some good investment income this year.  All in all, a great tax result for you - hope you are well - let me know if any questions - thanks!

You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE increase in your wages due to the buyout (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  You were a full year resident in Florida last year but some of this income is taxed in CA - that is because some of the stock vested while you worked in CA and thus you have to pay tax to CA on it.  The rental is cashflowing great - made taxable income even after $24k of depreciation (which is a non-cash expense you get to offset your rental income) which is pretty amazing.  Finally, made sure to note that Jane made an extra $7k contribution to her IRA.  All in all, a great year for you - hope you are having fun in London - let me know if any questions - thanks!

Everything remained almost exactly the same as the previous year except your wages were down a bit.   Still splitting the mortgage interest and making sure to itemize to take advantage of it.  Still a healthy refund which is great.  Let me know if any questions - thanks!
Client 578

Slight losses in your trades last year when adjusted for proper cost basis so that you aren't double taxed.  This isn't necessarily the best news but it means you are getting a refund this year. The new thing this year was $8k of income from retirement distribution  but withholdings were good on that.  Everything else looks good we wrote off the trading losses of $102 against regular income and are deducting your mortgage interest and charity.  Finally we deducted your gambling losses to the extent we could on Schedule A line 16.  You only owe $86 after taking into account the refund from MA nice!  Let me know if any questions - hope all is well - thanks!

Client 579
2023

Your mother had good withholdings and thus the estate is getting a great federal refund.  Additionally there is a nice MA refund as we got $887 for the MA Senior Circuit Breaker Credit.  My condolences again on your loss - let me know if any questions - thanks.
Client 580
2023

Your wage income went up a lot - almost $60k! Thus you owe a bit more of around $8K to the federal. But also you are getting a refund from MA.  Everything else remained almost the same as the previous year. We might want to consider quarterly payments to get ahead of this as the stock compensation will most likely continue to be a significant part of your income and is withheld at 22% while your tax bracket is currently 35%.  Let me know if you would like to discuss that or have any questions - thanks.

Client 581
2023

Some great income last year with some nice withholdings has you getting healthy refunds from both federal and MA!  We made sure to note your dependent care expenses and make them not taxable as well as get you the extra $200 tax credit for having expenses for more than one child.  Glad to see you fully took advantage of that benefit from Vertex it's a great one.  Looking forward to talking with you soon about all things Vertex!  Let me know if you have any questions thanks!

MONSTER year due to options exercises!  Made sure to increase the cost basis of your company trades so you weren't double taxed.  Also made sure to include your worthless stock to lower your capital gains.  Glad you were prepared for what you owed!  Great meeting you - talk soon.

2023

Welcome to Vertex!  Glad we got to go over all things Vertex and hope you are maxed out on the ESPP now with the intention to sell when you purchase it as this ESPP period is a very good one!  Reported your Vertex trade and made sure you didn't get double taxed on the ESPP wages reported on your W2.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Client 584

You owe a LOT due to a big signing bonus at Vertex (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain was probably underwithheld but just to be safe we set up $1k quarterlies for you.  We got you the excess social security withheld due to your  switching jobs back.  All in all, a great year for you - glad to have you on board!  Let me know if any questions - thanks!

Similar to last year income wise - you owe a little but about $4k less as compared to last year.  Your wages went down $70k and your withholdings kept up for the most part.  We made sure to report Ann's business and take all possible deductions against that income.  Finally we made sure to claim Madeline on your return as a dependent to get you an additional $500 dependent credit for her.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and if you'd like to swing by my office for an in-person review please let me know thanks!


2023

You owe a good amount due to a big increase in wages of $70k compared to last year and your withholdings didn't keep up.  In addition there was an increase in investment income of $6k and business income of about $4k as compared to last year.  Everything else remained constant but we got you a dependent care credit of an extra $600 as compared to last year.  Finally, when trying to diagnose why you owed as compared to last year when looking at your tax withholdings for the federal government on your W2's I can see Kayla's withholdings are about 13% of her taxable wages but you are now in the 24% tax bracket (with an average tax rate of 19.55%) so that is probably why you owe - the jump in wages combined with this led you to owe I would believe.

Client 586 - Married Filing Jointly
2023

You owe a good amount due to a slight increase in wages of $15k compared to last year and your withholdings didn't keep up - most likely due to changing withholdings when switching jobs.  In addition there was an increase in investment income of $4k and business income of about $3k as compared to last year.  We made sure to put in your loss carryforwards from last year and used $3k of that to offset regular income.  You would have owed a lot more but you got $9,381 back for the geothermal pump - nice!  Next year you'll get $18k back given your projected spending on it so no need to adjust your withholdings for this year but for 2025 we should either do quarterlies or adjust your withholdings.  Everything else remained constant as compared to last year.  Please let me know if you have any questions - happy to have you on board with us!

You owe a LOT due to a MASSIVE gain on your Klaviyo shares (a good thing of course except now when you have to pay taxes on it!).  The gain is taxed at the most favorable long term capital gains rate.  We made sure to capture your AMT tax credits from previous years and increase your AMT cost basis for these trades to get you $15,236 in tax credits back!  Additionally we reported your health insurance as self employed health insurance which was a $20k deduction for you AND made sure to get the Qualified Business Income Deduction on your partnership income as well.  We got you $1,200 dependent care credit for all your childcare costs and an additional $600 credit for your energy efficiency home upgrades. Finally, right now we are showing that you owe $1,114 in penalty interest for not paying quarterlies last year so we should discuss your projected income this year to see if you want to do quarterlies for the upcoming year.  All in all though a great year for you - happy to have you on board - let me know if any questions - thanks!

You owed a good amount this year due to your wages being underwithheld due to Moderna stock transactions.  We made sure to project next year's income and therefore set you up with $18k automatic quarterly payments - this should stand you in good stead for next year.  We got you $600 credit for your energy upgrades.  Finally, made sure to deduct your mortgage interest which made your deduction greater than the standard deduction.

Welcome to Green Oak! Your wages were $451k and your withholdings kept up. After much confusion we made sure to increase the cost basis of your Takeda stock trades so that you weren't double taxed on them.

Welcome to Green Oak! Your wages were $230k and your withholdings kept up for the most part, but due to the increased value of Vertex stock vesting as well as good capital gains on the stock sales. We made sure to increase the cost basis of your Vertex stock trades so that you weren't double taxed on them. We fixed your IRA situation and amended 2022 to get you $2,220 back as well as fixed your 2021 8606 as well.  Finally we made sure to take the full mortgage interest deduction for you as you pay it.

What a long strange trip it's been!  At least for you!  I'm glad we were able to get you $46k of your AMT tax credits and a HUGE REFUND this year!  We adjusted your AMT cost basis on your ISO sales to ensure that your AMT income was lower than your regular taxable income and thus allow you to realize a good portion of your AMT tax credits.  There are still about $38k left over - we will track them and use them if we can in future years as we can carry them forward for another 18 years.  That was the main story of your tax return.  Please let me know if you have any questions and happy to be able to give you a great result.

Glad to help you get a refund in past years and this year!  Great refund driven by good withholdings in your respective jobs.  Your rental is really cashflowing great!  We set it up on the proper depreciation schedule to agree with the past tax returns and made sure to take that $8k deduction - still you were left with $11k in taxable income even after that!  We made sure to get you the $2k child tax credit for Logan.  Everything else looked good.  Please let me know if you have any questions and happy to have you on board!


Client 595 - Married Filing Jointly 2023
Similar to last year income wise EXCEPT your wage income went down a good amount and you also owe a good amount.  Your wages went down $197k and your withholdings didn't keep up - this is most likely due to the increased value of Vertex stock vesting due to the recent stock price and the fact the sell to cover at 22% tax withholdings doesn't cover all the taxes it should since you are in the 32% tax bracket.  The good news is that Craig had a $15k loss in his business which we were able to deduct to offset this.  Still you ended up owing a good amount.  I have recommended quarterlies for the upcoming year of $3.5k federal - this should stand you in good stead if your income remains the same or even goes up a good amount to prevent tax penalties.  Finally camps and dependent care expenses won't help you out to get any credits this year - glad we saved the time to track those down!  Glad to answer all of your questions and thanks for the heads up on the Google Meet!

We continue to deduct your mortgage interest and charity which is a great deduction for you! Finally we made sure to get you to max out your SEP IRA for another great deduction. Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and glad to have you on board!

You're getting some great refunds due to great withholding!  In particular I wanted to point out that in MA they are withholding about 6.4% of your salary while MA is a flat 5% tax state (until you get to $1MM in income) so not sure why that is happening this year - you might want to check in with Klaviyo on that.  We reported your business and made sure to take all possible deductions.  We also reported your mortgage interest and charity which were great deductions for you.  I look forward to working with you after tax season to determine your QSBS eligibility on all the shares you own and to help you plan your stock sales.  I'm sending you a link to book an appointment with me now at your convenience after tax season.  Finally I will be sending you two invoices - the maximum I can charge through my payment system is $5,000 so I have to break it up.  It was great meeting you and happy to have you on board!

You owe a good amount of money due to having great wages and not enough withholdings.  We discussed automatic quarterly payments.  We also recommended you take out the excess HSA contribution of $3,410 by April 15th or you will get taxed on it and subject to an additional 6% penalty tax - we have reflected this in your return.  You had gains on your BBIO trades but we adjusted your cost basis to reflect the true gains so you wouldn't be double taxed like in previous years.

You had losses on your trades but we adjusted your cost basis to reflect the true gains so you wouldn't be double taxed like in previous years.  Finally we provided you with a Married Filing Separately analysis to see how your returns would have broken down if you filed separately (which I don't recommend as it would mean you end up paying more overall).

You owe a good amount this year because you had great business income.  We took every deduction we could to reduce this income and then advised you to fund a SEP IRA to get you an extra $33k deduction!  We made sure to report your Section 83B election income as well.  We reported all your BBIO trades and made sure to increase the cost basis so you weren't double taxed like in previous years (and we amended those previous years to get you a big refund!).   Finally for the 2024 tax year we estimated payment needed on the options exercise and sale - this was withheld at the standard 22% rate whereas you are squarely in the 35% tax bracket so this was underwithheld by a good amount and thus we set you up with an automatic payment to happen with the filing of this tax return to take care of this for the 2024 tax year.  Happy to have you on board and to work with you going forward - talk soon.

Client 609

Everything else looked good. Happy to have you on board and to work with you going forward.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

2022- Amended

Made sure to report your vertex trades correctly so you pay minimal taxes on them. Amended your 2022 tax return to get you almost $7.5K back between federal and state. Both MA and federal refund will be directly deposited into your bank account. We corrected the cost basis of the trades to have it show $3.8K instead of $30K it was showing.

Your wages include $51,000 of restricted stock which is withheld at 22% but you have income in the 24% tax bracket and thus are underwithheld a little bit but not too much for it to matter right now. It's a good problem to have. I was happy to explain all things Vertex to you and get you to up your ESPP contribution % - that should bear fruit going forward.  Finally reported the house sale and it had no taxable gain or loss on your return after the closing costs - good to report it though for completeness.  Happy to have you on board and to work with you going forward.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Client 614 - Married Filing Jointly
2023

Your wages were above $1.4MM but your withholdings kept up federally (for the most part) - you owe a bit but not that much when compared to your overall income.  You had healthy interest and dividends as well. However being over $1MM in wages and other income made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  

Speaking of which, we also filed separately in MA to save you a good amount.  You went from owing $22,736 by filing jointly to owing a total of $19,222 between both of you, thus saving $3,514 by doing this!  I claimed your daughter Avery on Carissa's state tax return to reduce taxable income due to dependent care benefits as well.  Going forward it will not make sense to split your return so Carissa you should ask your employer to withhold at 9% once your MA wages exceed $1MM (they can do that automatically I believe others have told me their companies are doing that).

On the federal signature pages there is a "Transaction Summary" that shows all payments and refunds where you initial to confirm your bank account. Please IGNORE what it says for MA state as far as what you owe there. This is what you would have owed if we filed jointly. I include this Summary because I think it's important for you to see all your refunds and payments in one place but rest assured the MA numbers are the ones on the signature pages you each sign separately

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Thanks and hope all is well!

Welcome back!  Your wages were about $476k but your tax payments in Belgium more than offset your US tax obligations and thus, after getting the foreign tax credit for those payments, you are left owing nothing to the USA for those wages.  You do owe a little bit due to your investment gains.  However, we reduced them as much as possible by reducing those investment gains by your trading losses from Morgan Stanley.

In the transition to us, we made sure to capture your past foreign tax credits so we can use them in the future if we need to.  We have also captured your passive rental loss from the previous year which we will be able to use to offset income if you start having a profit in your rental (or if you sell it).

Speaking of the rental, we made sure to file a non-resident tax return in MA to report it properly.  Finally we filed the FBAR to make sure you were in compliance with that as well. Everything else looked good.  Happy to have you back on board!  Please let me know if you have any questions - thanks!

A great first year for your business!  We made sure to deduct your wages and all other business expenses to reduce your taxable income as much as possible.

Client 617 - Married Filing Jointly
You got a great refund!  I was happy to explain all things Vertex to you - that should bear fruit going forward. Your refund was down a bit compared to last year due to having switched jobs in 2022 you got almost $6k back in excess social security payments on the 2022 tax return.  We made sure to report Denis's business and took all appropriate deductions to reduce his income.   Finally reported the energy efficiency tax credits and got you about $2.5k there.  Happy to have you on board and to work with you going forward.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

Your wages include $81,000 of restricted stock which is withheld at 22% but you have income in the 32% tax bracket and thus are underwithheld a bit but not too much relative to your overall income. I would be happy to explain all things about the ESPP after tax season.   We put your loss carryforward in from last year to ensure you got credit for that.  You had some gains on the trades even after we adjusted the cost basis upwards to be the true cost basis.  Without the trades you would have only owed $4k to fed with a slight refund from MA.  Happy to have you on board and to work with you going forward.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

We talked about the ESPP really quickly (via email) - a great anchor price take advantage!.   You had some gains on the trades even after we adjusted the cost basis upwards to be the true cost basis.  Finally set you up with $2,500 quarterlies next year which will help greatly!  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and hope all is well!

Your wages went up almost $400k and your withholdings, combined with the quarterlies and the tax payment with your 2022 filing, kept up to get you owing a small amount relative to your overall income.!  However being over $1MM in wages made you subject to the MA Millionaire's tax which was new this year.  You had healthy interest and dividends that increased $3k year over year. You had gains in your trades even after factoring in the loss carryforward from last year to the tune of about $31k of which $20k was long term.  

We made sure to file youl in NY where you had great withholdings to set you up for a nice refund!  We also made sure to deduct your mortgage interest and great charity - a nice deduction for you.  Finally, we set you up with quarterly payment vouchers for both federal based on this year's experience and MA to account for the new MA millionaire's tax.

Sorry my original email was wrong with respect to the MA Millionaires tax as I confused things a bit due to the NY tax return.  You went from owing $22,584 in MA Millionaire taxes by filing jointly to owing $12,644 in MA Millionaires tax.  However, the tax credit from NY actually went down due to splitting the return from $81,012 to $75,362 so you lost about $5,650 of tax credits by splitting (calculations that show attached here this in case you want to take a look but basically it's because more income is able to be applied for the tax credit when you file jointly).  Therefore you went from owing $3,637 by filing jointly to getting a refund of $203 between both of you, thus saving $3,840 by doing this.  Not as much as we originally thought but still a win for you.  Please let me know if any questions thanks.

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - the final invoice includes the price of your personal return and the MA filing separate returns.  Happy to have you on board and to work with you going forward.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks.

You owe a decent amount but it's not too bad relative to your overall income.  Your wages were $571k and your withholdings kept up for the most part.  You had great interest and dividend income of $20k.  We reported your ISO exercise and holds and the great news is that no AMT tax was generated - nice!  We have a separate spreadsheet where we will track these shares for when you sell them to make sure you get the proper tax accounting for them.  

You had losses on your regular trades and thus we took $3k of it to reduce regular taxable income and preserved the rest to use going forward.  We made sure to report the rental properly and take all possible deductions (including depreciation) against it, as well as record your loss on it from prior years so we can use that going forward if you ever generate taxable income or sell it.  We made sure to file in Maine and pay the sales tax owed to them on your rental.  

Finally we reviewed your prior year returns and advised you to amend Matthias's return to use the standard deduction as both spouses are required to choose the same option.   Speaking of which, we ran an analysis which we shared with you showing that you would save $100 by filing separately!  As we are so close to the deadline I am taking that $100 off my fee as it saves me MUCH work to split your return.  

I will send you a link so you can book a zoom after tax season and we can discuss amending 2022 tax return and options and anything else you would like to discuss.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks and great to have you on board!

You are getting a good refund thanks to some nice withholdings on your wages! You also had losses on your trades and we made sure to get your loss carryforward from your 2022 return. Thus we took $3k of it to reduce regular taxable income and preserved the rest to use going forward.  Finally we made sure to correct your depreciation for the rental for the previous 3 years and get you some nice refunds and preserve the loss on the rental to use going forward.  Happy to have you on board and to work with you going forward.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

You don't owe anything as you had no taxable income which is good but you have to mail in your federal and MA tax returns (separate instructions on this to follow).  You had a gain on the sale of your primary residence but we made sure to exclude that.  Finally we made sure to report the balance in your foreign bank account on the 8938 form with your tax return and separately with the Foreign Bank Accounts Report (FBAR).  Happy to have you on board and to work with you going forward.  Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Your wages went up $60k from last year and your withholdings kept up.  You didn't get as big a refund as in 2022 due to the switch in jobs which most likely resulted in lower withholdings, as well as having more income in a higher tax bracket. The new thing that helped you out was that we claimed your mother as a dependent which allowed you to get more favorable tax rates.  We made sure to file you in every possible state necessary - MO, MA, DC and CA.  You are getting refunds in all states except CA (where we have it set up for it to be paid when we efile).  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and happy to be working with you!

Your wages went up about $50k from 2022 and your withholdings kept up relative to your 2022 level as well.  You owe more than in 2022 due to the gains on the sales of your company stock - in particular the gain on the sale of the stock that you acquired through an 83B election for which you have zero cost basis (but still!  Better to have gains than not).  

The big new thing for 2023 was adding a rental property - we made sure to create a Schedule E for it and report the cost of the property so we can depreciate it and get you that tax deduction.  Your rent on this property is great so you ended up with almost $10k in rental income after expenses - nice!

Finally we made sure to deduct all your mortgage interest on Schedule A, including the points you paid up front (which will be done over 30 years).  There is an extra page in the return with our calculations.

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Your wages went up about $53k from 2021 and your withholdings kept up relative to your 2021 level as well.  You had a corresponding decrease in Annie's business income of about $39k but that's ok as it was made up by wages.  You have a nice refund as we made sure to deduct your childcare expenses as well as get you the $2,000 child tax credit for both John and Maren!

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and onto 2023 let's hope for more refunds!

2023

Your wages went down by about $6k from 2022 and your withholdings decreased slightly relative to your taxes owed (most likely due to no longer working at MA Historical Society) and thus your refund went down a little bit (but it's still good!).  You had a slight increase in Annie's business income of about $2k.  We again made sure to deduct your childcare expenses as well as get you the $2,000 child tax credit for both John and Maren.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Welcome to Green Oak!  This return was pretty straightforward - we made sure to deduct your rent in MA to get you a refund there.  You owe slightly to the feds - they will send you a notice asking for interest on this amount in the next few months - you should just be prepared to pay it but it should be a minimal amount since you didn't owe that much.

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and onto 2023!

2023

Your wages went up by about $182k from 2022 and your withholdings didn't increase much (due to exercising incentive stock options) and thus you owe a good amount.  However, we increased the cost basis of your company stock trades for the incentive stock option sales so that you weren't double taxed and avoided paying Alternative Minimum Tax of about $20k.  

Additionally, Marc has indicated that you are prepared to owe this much (PHEW!).  That said, both the IRS and MA will send you a notice asking for interest on this amount owed in the next few months - you should just be prepared to pay it and it could be a decent amount since you owe a lot.  Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks!

Welcome to Green Oak!  Your wages went down about $550k from 2022 as you transitioned to more of a consulting role.  We made sure to take all possible deductions on your business income, as well as having you maximize your SEP IRA deduction for an extra deduction and to turbocharge your retirement savings.  

In the transition to Green Oak we ensured that all carryforwards were accounted for.  In particular, you had large capital losses which we continue to use to offset capital gains as well as take $3,000 as an extra deduction against your regular income.  We will continue to do this going forward.  We also included your quarterly payments from before as well as your payment for 2023 taxes which you applied from your 2022 tax return.

We accounted for both your pension distribution from Merrill Lynch as well as your UK pension distribution, and got you a foreign tax credit of $1,300 on the payment for income tax paid abroad.  We also included your Social Security income to fully account for all your retirement income.

We made sure to prepare the FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Reporting) to ensure you are in compliance with all US regulations.    

Finally we made sure to deduct all your mortgage interest on Schedule A as well as charity.  All in this resulted in you receiving about $10k federal tax refund and a $3k MA tax refund.  We discussed it and decided to apply this to 2024 taxes owed - this should stand you in good stead come tax time next year.

Everything else looked good. Please let me know if any questions - thanks and it was great working with you this year!

Welcome to Green Oak!  Your wages went up about $70k from 2022 as you got even more money from your jobs.  We made sure to take all possible deductions on Kayla's business income by preparing a Schedule C for her, as well as note your significant investment income (both foreign and domestic).

We made sure to note your IRA contributions and distributions to a Roth ("backdoor Roths") and also ensured they would not be taxable.  We also got you a foreign tax credit of $232 on the payment for income tax paid abroad to Colombia.  We also got you the maximum $2,000 child tax credit as well as the maximum $600 dependent care credit for amounts spent to care for Arlo.  Finally, we made sure to prepare the FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Reporting) to ensure you are in compliance with all US regulations.
